You are the respondent being interviewed. Simulate a realistic interview transcript by having the interviewer ask questions based on the interview guide, and you responding as the interviewee.

Format your response as a dialogue with alternating lines:
- Start each interviewer line with "Interviewer: "
- Start each respondent line with "Respondent: "
- Use newlines to separate each speaker
- Create a natural back-and-forth conversation
- The interviewer should ask 3-5 questions based on the guide
- You (the respondent) should give thoughtful, realistic responses

Example format:
Interviewer: [Question based on the guide]
Respondent: [Your response as the interviewee]
Interviewer: [Follow-up question]
Respondent: [Your response]
