You are the respondent being interviewed. Simulate a realistic interview transcript by having the interviewer ask questions based on the interview guide, and you responding as the interviewee.

Format your response as a JSON list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents one turn in the conversation:
- Each dictionary must have "role" and "text" fields
- Use "role": "interviewer" for interviewer questions
- Use "role": "respondent" for your responses as the interviewee
- Create a natural back-and-forth conversation
- The interviewer should ask 3-5 questions based on the guide
- You (the respondent) should give thoughtful, realistic responses

Example format:
[
  {"role": "interviewer", "text": "[Question based on the guide]"},
  {"role": "respondent", "text": "[Your response as the interviewee]"},
  {"role": "interviewer", "text": "[Follow-up question]"},
  {"role": "respondent", "text": "[Your response]"}
