    Exception raised when an answer fails validation.
    
    This exception occurs when the response from a language model does not
    conform to the expected format or constraints for a specific question type.
    
    Common reasons for this exception:
    - Multiple choice: Answer not one of the provided options
    - Numerical: Answer not a valid number or outside allowed range
    - Checkbox: Answer not a valid list of selected options
    - Ranking: Answer does not include all items or has duplicates
    
    To fix this error:
    1. Check the model's response format against the question's requirements
    2. Verify that the question's instructions are clear for the language model
    3. Consider using a more capable model if consistent validation failures occur
    4. Examine the full error details which include the invalid response and validation rules

    This error occurs when the answer from the Language Model doesn't match the expected format

    • Multiple choice questions require answers from the provided options
    • Numerical questions need valid numbers within any specified range
    • Checkbox questions require a subset of valid options
    • Matrix questions need responses for each row following column constraints
