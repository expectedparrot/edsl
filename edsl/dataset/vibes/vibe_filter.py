    Filter datasets using natural language criteria.

    This class uses an LLM to generate Python filtering logic based on natural
    language descriptions. It creates executable filter expressions that can be
    applied to datasets.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : str
        The OpenAI model to use (default: "gpt-4o")
    temperature : float
        Temperature for generation (default: 0.1 for consistent logic)

    Examples
    --------
    >>> filter_tool = VibeFilter()
    >>> filter_expr = filter_tool.create_filter(
    ...     columns=["age", "occupation"],
    ...     sample_data=[{"age": 25, "occupation": "student"}, {"age": 35, "occupation": "engineer"}],

        Generate a Python filter expression from natural language criteria.

        Parameters
        ----------
        columns : List[str]
            List of column names available in the dataset

            - "Only include responses from the last month"
            - "Filter out any rows with missing data"

        Returns
        -------
        str
            A Python expression that can be evaluated to filter rows.
            The expression should return True to keep a row, False to filter it out.
