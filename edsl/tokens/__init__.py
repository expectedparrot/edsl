"""
The tokens module provides functionality for tracking and analyzing token usage in EDSL.

This module implements classes for tracking and reporting token usage across various
components of EDSL, particularly for language model calls. It supports aggregation,
cost calculation, and reporting of token usage metrics.

Key components:
1. TokenUsage - Tracks prompt and completion tokens for a single operation
2. InterviewTokenUsage - Aggregates token usage across an entire interview
3. Exception classes for handling token-related errors

The token tracking system helps with:
- Cost estimation and billing
- Resource utilization analysis
- Cache effectiveness measurement
- API quota management
