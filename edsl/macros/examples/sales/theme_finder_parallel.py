"""
Parallel Theme Finder App for EDSL

A high-performance theme extraction implementation that leverages EDSL's parallel
processing to generate, consolidate, validate, and apply themes to free text responses.

This version properly uses EDSL's .to() chaining for multi-stage pipelines and
processes responses in parallel for maximum efficiency.
