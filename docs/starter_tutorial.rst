Starter Tutorial
================

This tutorial provides example code for getting started using EDSL, an open-source Python library for simulating surveys, experiments and other research tasks using AI agents and large language models.
EDSL is available under the MIT License at `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/edsl/>`_ and `GitHub <https://github.com/expectedparrot/edsl>`_.

In the steps below we show how to construct and run a simple question in EDSL, and then how to design more complex surveys with AI agents and different language models.
We also demonstrate methods for applying logic and rules to surveys, piping answers and adding data to questions, and analyzing survey results as datasets.

You can also `view this notebook at the Coop <https://www.expectedparrot.com/content/26d569e1-8356-45b7-9786-471dda1710ce>`_, a platform for creating, storing and sharing AI-based research.
Coop is fully integrated with EDSL and free to use.
Learn more in the `Coop <https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/coop.html>`_ section of the documentation.

Please also see an :ref:`overview` of features and common use cases for EDSL, and a :ref:`checklist` of tips on using EDSL effectively.
If you encounter any issues or have questions, please email us at info@expectedparrot.com or post a question at our `Discord channel <https://discord.com/invite/mxAYkjfy9m>`_.


Technical setup
---------------

To run the examples below you first need to install the EDSL library and choose how you want to access language models.

*Note:* If you are using EDSL in Colab, please see the `Colab setup <https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/colab_setup.html>`_ page for additional instructions.


Install EDSL
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Run the following code to install the EDSL library. See :ref:`installation` instructions for more details.

.. code-block:: python

  pip install edsl


If you have already installed EDSL, you can check the version by running the following code and comparing the output to the version shown at PyPI:

.. code-block:: python

  pip show edsl 


If your version of EDSL is not up to date, run the following code to update it:

.. code-block:: python

  pip install --upgrade edsl


Choose how to access language models
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Next, decide how you want to access language models with EDSL and obtain the required API keys:

* *Remote inference*: This method allows you to run surveys at the Expected Parrot server and access all available language models at once with your Expected Parrot API key.
<br>
* *Local inference*: Alternatively, you can obtain your own API keys for service providers to run EDSL on your own machine.

Your Expected Parrot API key can be found at the Settings page of your `Coop account <https://www.expectedparrot.com/login>`_, where you can select the option to `activate remote inference <https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/remote_inference.html>`_. 
This key also allows you to `post and share content at the Coop <https://www.expectedparrot.com/content/explore>`_ that you create using either remote or local inference.


Store your API keys
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Make your keys available to EDSL by storing then in a file named "**.env**" in your working directory. Modify the code below (replacing '**your_key_here**' with each key that you want to use) and then run it to create an .env file in your current directory (the folder where you are running this notebooK). 

If you already have a *.env* file, you can use the template below to modify the contents of the file instead of running the code to avoid overwriting it.

If you are using remote inference, you only need to store your Expected Parrot API key.

**Note: Your API keys should be treated like passwords and deleted from notebooks or content that you share with others. We recommend deleting your keys from the code below after your .env file has been created.**

.. code-block:: python 

  with open('.env', 'w') as f:
    f.write('''
  # Environment variables file
  EXPECTED_PARROT_API_KEY = 'your_key_here'

  ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = 'your_key_here'
  DEEP_INFRA_API_KEY = 'your_key_here'
  GOOGLE_API_KEY = 'your_key_here'
  GROQ_API_KEY = 'your_key_here'
  MISTRAL_API_KEY = 'your_key_here'
  OPENAI_API_KEY = 'your_key_here'
  REPLICATE_API_KEY = 'your_key_here'
  ''')


Example: Running a simple question
----------------------------------

EDSL comes with a `variety of question types <https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/questions.html>`_ that we can choose from based on the form of the response that we want to get back from a model.
To see a list of all question types:

.. code-block:: python

  from edsl import Question

  Question.available()


Output:

.. list-table::
  :header-rows: 1

  * - question_type
    - question_class
    - example_question
  * - checkbox
    - QuestionCheckBox
    - Question('checkbox', name="never_eat", text="Which foods would you eat?", min=2, max=5, options=['soggy meatpie', 'rare snails', 'mouldy bread', 'panda milk custard', 'McDonalds'])
  * - extract 
    - QuestionExtract
    - Question('extract', name="extract_name", text="My name is Moby Dick...", template={'name': 'John Doe', 'profession': 'Carpenter'})
  * - free_text
    - QuestionFreeText  
    - Question('free_text', name="how_are_you", text="How are you?")
  * - functional
    - QuestionFunctional
    - Question('functional', name="sum_and_multiply", text="Calculate sum and multiply by trait multiplier.")
  * - likert_five
    - QuestionLikertFive
    - Question('likert_five', name="happy_raining", text="I'm only happy when it rains.", options=['Strongly disagree'-'Strongly agree'])
  * - linear_scale
    - QuestionLinearScale
    - Question('linear_scale', name="ice_cream", text="How much do you like ice cream?", options=[1-5], labels={1:'hate', 5:'love'})
  * - list
    - QuestionList
    - Question('list', name="list_of_foods", text="What are your favorite foods?")
  * - multiple_choice
    - QuestionMultipleChoice
    - Question('multiple_choice', name="how_feeling", text="How are you?", options=['Good','Great','OK','Bad'])
  * - numerical
    - QuestionNumerical
    - Question('numerical', name="age", text="You are 45. How old are you?", min=0, max=86.7)
  * - rank
    - QuestionRank
    - Question('rank', name="rank_foods", text="Rank your favorite foods.", options=['Pizza','Pasta','Salad','Soup'], num=2)
  * - top_k
    - QuestionTopK
    - Question('top_k', name="two_fruits", text="Which fruits do you prefer?", min=2, max=2, options=['apple','banana','carrot','durian'])
  * - yes_no
    - QuestionYesNo
    - Question('yes_no', name="is_it_equal", text="Is 5 + 5 equal to 11?", options=['No','Yes'])
 

We can see the components of a particular question type by importing the question type class and calling the `example` method on it:

.. code-block:: python

  from edsl import (
      # QuestionCheckBox,
      # QuestionExtract,
      # QuestionFreeText,
      # QuestionFunctional,
      # QuestionLikertFive,
      # QuestionLinearScale,
      # QuestionList,
      QuestionMultipleChoice,
      # QuestionNumerical,
      # QuestionRank,
      # QuestionTopK,
      # QuestionYesNo
  )

  q = QuestionMultipleChoice.example() # substitute any question type class name
  q


Output:

.. list-table::
  :header-rows: 1

  * - keys
    - values
  * - question_name
    - how_feeling
  * - question_text
    - How are you?
  * - question_options
    - ['Good', 'Great', 'OK', 'Bad']
  * - include_comment
    - False
  * - question_type
    - multiple_choice


Here we create a simple multiple choice question:

.. code-block:: python

  from edsl import QuestionMultipleChoice

  q = QuestionMultipleChoice(
      question_name = "smallest_prime",
      question_text = "Which is the smallest prime number?",
      question_options = [0, 1, 2, 3]
  )


We can administer it to a language model by calling the run method (note: if remote inference has been activated, information about the job and results will be stored on the Expected Parrot server and URLs will be displayed):

.. code-block:: python

  results = q.run()


This generates a dataset of `Results` that we can readily access with `built-in methods for analysis <https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/results.html>`_. 
Here we inspect the response, together with the model that was used and the model's "comment" about its response--a field that is automatically added to all question types other than free text:

.. code-block:: python

  results.select("model", "smallest_prime", "smallest_prime_comment")


Output:

.. list-table::
  :header-rows: 1

  * - model.model
    - answer.smallest_prime
    - comment.smallest_prime_comment
  * - gpt-4o
    - 2
    - 2 is the smallest prime number because it is the only even number greater than 1 that is divisible only by 1 and itself.


The `Results` also include information about the question, model parameters, prompts, generated tokens and raw responses. 
To see a list of all the components:

.. code-block:: python

    results.columns


Output:

.. list-table::
  :header-rows: 1 

  * - 
    - 'agent.agent_instruction',
    - 'agent.agent_name',
    - 'answer.smallest_prime',
    - 'comment.smallest_prime_comment',
    - 'generated_tokens.smallest_prime_generated_tokens',
    - 'iteration.iteration',
    - 'model.frequency_penalty',
    - 'model.logprobs',
    - 'model.max_tokens',
    - 'model.model',
    - 'model.presence_penalty',
    - 'model.temperature',
    - 'model.top_logprobs',
    - 'model.top_p',
    - 'prompt.smallest_prime_system_prompt',
    - 'prompt.smallest_prime_user_prompt',
    - 'question_options.smallest_prime_question_options',
    - 'question_text.smallest_prime_question_text',
    - 'question_type.smallest_prime_question_type',
    - 'raw_model_response.smallest_prime_cost',
    - 'raw_model_response.smallest_prime_one_usd_buys',
    - 'raw_model_response.smallest_prime_raw_model_response']


Example: Conducting a survey with agents and models
---------------------------------------------------

In the next example we construct a more complex survey consisting of multiple questions and design personas for AI agents to answer it.
Then we select specific language models to generate the answers.

We start by creating questions in different types and passing them to a `Survey`:

.. code-block:: python 

    from edsl import QuestionLinearScale, QuestionFreeText

    q_enjoy = QuestionLinearScale(
        question_name = "enjoy",
        question_text = "On a scale from 1 to 5, how much do you enjoy reading?",
        question_options = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
        option_labels = {1:"Not at all", 5:"Very much"}
    )

    q_favorite_place = QuestionFreeText(
        question_name = "favorite_place",
        question_text = "Describe your favorite place for reading."
    )


We construct a `Survey` by passing a list of questions:

.. code-block:: python

    from edsl import Survey

    survey = Survey(questions = [q_enjoy, q_favorite_place])


Agents
^^^^^^

An important feature of EDSL is the ability to create AI agents to answer questions.
This is done by passing dictionaries of relevant "traits" to `Agent` objects that are used by language models to generate responses.
Learn more about `designing agents <https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/agents.html>`_.

Here we construct several simple agent personas to use with our survey:

.. code-block:: python 

  from edsl import AgentList, Agent

  agents = AgentList(
      Agent(traits = {"persona":p}) for p in ["artist", "mechanic", "sailor"]
  )


Language models 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

EDSL works with many popular large language models that we can select to use with a survey.
This makes it easy to compare responses among models in the results that are generated.

To see a current list of available models:

.. code-block:: python 

  from edsl import Model

  # Model.available() # uncomment this code and run it to see the list of available models


To check the default model that will be used if no models are specified for a survey (e.g., as in the first example above):

.. code-block:: python

  Model()


Output (may be different if the default model has changed):

.. list-table::
  :header-rows: 1

  * - keys
    - values
  * - model
    - gpt-4o
  * - temperature
    - 0.5
  * - max_tokens
    - 1000
  * - top_p
    - 1
  * - frequency_penalty
    - 0
  * - presence_penalty
    - 0
  * - logprobs
    - False
  * - top_logprobs
    - 3


Here we select some models to use with our survey:

.. code-block:: python 

  from edsl import ModelList, Model

  models = ModelList(
      Model(m) for m in ["gpt-4o", "gemini-pro"]
      )


Running a survey
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We add agents and models to a survey using the `by` method.
Then we administer a survey the same way that we do an individual question, by calling the `run` method on it:

.. code-block:: python

  results = survey.by(agents).by(models).run()

  (
      results
      .sort_by("persona", "model")
      .select("model", "persona", "enjoy", "favorite_place")
  )

Example output:

.. list-table::
  :header-rows: 1

  * - model.model
    - agent.persona
    - answer.enjoy
    - answer.favorite_place
  * - gemini-pro
    - artist
    - 5
    - Nestled amidst the verdant embrace of a sprawling park, my favorite reading sanctuary unfolds as a secluded haven where tranquility reigns supreme. Beneath the towering canopy of ancient oak trees, a quaint bench beckons, its weathered surface inviting me to sink into its embrace. As I settle in, the gentle rustling of leaves overhead creates a soothing symphony that calms my mind and prepares me for the literary journey ahead. The air is fragrant with the sweet scent of blooming wildflowers, carried by a soft breeze that whispers secrets through the trees. The vibrant hues of nature paint the canvas around me, inspiring a sense of wonder and connection to the world. As I open the pages of my chosen book, the outside world fades into oblivion. The words dance before my eyes, inviting me into realms unknown. The characters become my companions, their stories unfolding before me like a captivating tapestry. Time seems to stand still in this idyllic setting. The worries of the day dissolve as I immerse myself in the written word. The worries of the day dissolve as I immerse myself in the written word. The worries of the day dissolve as I immerse myself in the written word. As the sun begins its descent, casting long shadows across the park, I close my book and savor the lingering glow of the day. The world around me has transformed into a magical realm, where the boundaries between reality and imagination blur.

    - Amidst the bustling city's cacophony, I seek solace in a sanctuary of tranquility—my favorite reading nook. Nestled in a cozy corner of my apartment, it is an oasis of serenity. The soft glow of a vintage lamp illuminates a comfortable armchair, its plush cushions inviting me to sink into its embrace. A large window frames a vibrant cityscape, providing a backdrop of constant movement and life. Yet, within this cozy haven, I find stillness and escape. The walls are adorned with an eclectic collection of artwork, each piece evoking a different memory or inspiration. A vibrant abstract painting captures the essence of a stormy sea, while a delicate watercolor depicts the serene beauty of a mountain meadow. These visual cues transport me to distant realms, setting the stage for literary adventures. The air is scented with the faint aroma of freshly brewed coffee and the subtle fragrance of old books. The gentle hum of the city outside fades into a distant murmur, creating an atmosphere conducive to deep contemplation and immersion. As I settle into my armchair, I reach for a book. Its pages hold the promise of countless worlds to explore, characters to meet, and lessons to learn. The weight of the book in my hands feels both comforting and exhilarating, a tangible connection to the boundless possibilities within its covers. With each turn of the page, I am transported to different times and places. I witness the rise and fall of empires, the triumphs and tragedies of human lives, and the wonders of the natural world. The words dance before my eyes, painting vivid images in my mind. I become lost in the stories, my own worries and concerns fading away.

    - Ah, my favorite place for reading has to be the deck of a ship, with the vast ocean stretching out endlessly before me. There's something about the gentle rocking of the waves and the salty sea breeze that makes any book come alive. I love settling into a sturdy deck chair, perhaps with a mug of strong coffee or a tot of rum by my side, and losing myself in a tale while the sun sets on the horizon, painting the sky with colors that even the best of stories can't quite capture. The sound of the water lapping against the hull provides a soothing background, making it the perfect spot to dive into a good book.


Example: Adding context to questions
------------------------------------

EDSL provides a variety of ways to add data or content to survey questions. 
These methods include:

* `Piping <https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/surveys.html#id2>`_ answers to questions into follow-on questions
* `Adding "memory" <https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/surveys.html#question-memory>`_ of prior questions and answers in a survey when presenting other questions to a model
* `Parameterizing questions with data <https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/scenarios.html>`_, e.g., content from PDFs, CSVs, docs, images or other sources that you want to add to questions

Piping question answers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here we demonstrate how to pipe the answer to a question into the text of another question.
This is done by using a placeholder `{{ <question_name>.answer }}` in the text of the follow-on question where the answer to the prior question is to be inserted when the survey is run.
This causes the questions to be administered in the required order (survey questions are administered asynchronously by default).
Learn more about `piping question answers <https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/surveys.html#id2>`_.

Here we insert the answer to a numerical question into the text of a follow-on yes/no question:

.. code-block:: python 

  from edsl import QuestionNumerical, QuestionYesNo, Survey

  q1 = QuestionNumerical(
      question_name = "random_number",
      question_text = "Pick a random number between 1 and 1,000."
  )

  q2 = QuestionYesNo(
      question_name = "prime",
      question_text = "Is this a prime number: {{ random_number.answer }}"
  )

  survey = Survey([q1, q2])

  results = survey.run()


We can check the `user_prompt` for the `prime` question to verify that that the answer to the `random_number` question was piped into it:

.. code-block:: python

  results.select("random_number", "prime_user_prompt", "prime", "prime_comment")


Example output:

.. list-table::
  :header-rows: 1

  * - answer.random_number
    - prompt.prime_user_prompt
    - answer.prime
    - comment.prime_comment
  * - 487
    - Is this a prime number: 487 No Yes Only 1 option may be selected. Please respond with just your answer. After the answer, you can put a comment explaining your response.
    - No
    - 487 is not a prime number because it can be divided evenly by 1, 487, and also by 19 and 25.


Adding "memory" of questions and answers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here we instead add a "memory" of the first question and answer to the context of the second question.
This is done by calling a memory rule and identifying the question(s) to add.
Instead of just the answer, information about the full question and answer are presented with the follow-on question text, and no placeholder is used.
Learn more about `question memory rules <https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/surveys.html#survey-rules-logic>`_.

Here we demonstrate the `add_targeted_memory` method (we could also use `set_full_memory_mode` or other memory rules):

.. code-block:: python 

  from edsl import QuestionNumerical, QuestionYesNo, Survey

  q1 = QuestionNumerical(
      question_name = "random_number",
      question_text = "Pick a random number between 1 and 1,000."
  )

  q2 = QuestionYesNo(
      question_name = "prime",
      question_text = "Is the number you picked a prime number?"
  )

  survey = Survey([q1, q2]).add_targeted_memory(q2, q1)

  results = survey.run()


We can again use the `user_prompt` to verify the context that was added to the follow-on question:

.. code-block:: python

  results.select("random_number", "prime_user_prompt", "prime", "prime_comment").table().long()


Example output:

.. list-table::
  :header-rows: 1

  * - row
    - key
    - value
  * - 0
    - answer.random_number
    - 487
  * - 0
    - prompt.prime_user_prompt
    - Is the number you picked a prime number? No Yes Only 1 option may be selected. Please respond with just your answer. After the answer, you can put a comment explaining your response. Before the question you are now answering, you already answered the following question(s): Question: Pick a random number between 1 and 1,000. Answer: 487
  * - 0
    - answer.prime
    - Yes
  * - 0
    - comment.prime_comment
    - 487 is a prime number because it has no divisors other than 1 and itself.


Scenarios
---------

We can also add external data or content to survey questions.
This can be useful when you want to efficiently create and administer multiple versions of questions at once, e.g., for conducting data labeling tasks.
This is done by creating `Scenario` dictionaries for the data or content to be used with a survey, where the keys match `{{ placeholder }}` names used in question texts (or question options) and the values are the content to be added.
Scenarios can also be used to `add metadata to survey results <https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/notebooks/adding_metadata.html>`_, e.g., data sources or other information that you may want to include in the results for reference but not necessarily include in question texts.

In the next example we revise the prior survey questions about reading to take a parameter for other activities that we may want to add to the questions, and create simple scenarios for some activities.
EDSL provides methods for automatically generating scenarios from a variety of data sources, including PDFs, CSVs, docs, images, tables and dicts. 
We use the `from_list` method to convert a list of activities into scenarios.

Then we demonstrate how to use scenarios to create multiple versions of our questions either (i) when constructing a survey or (ii) when running it:

* In the latter case, the `by` method is used to add scenarios to a survey of questions with placeholders at the time that it is run (the same way that agents and models are added to a survey). This adds a `scenario` column to the results with a row for each answer to each question for each scenario.
* In the former case, the `loop` method is used to create a list of versions of a question with the scenarios already added to it; when the questions are passed to a survey and it is run, the results include columns for each individual question; there is no `scenario` column and a single row for each agent's answers to all the questions.

Learn more about `using scenarios <https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/scenarios.html>`_.

Here we create simple scenarios for a list of activities:

.. code-block:: python 

  from edsl import ScenarioList, Scenario

  scenarios = ScenarioList.from_list("activity", ["reading", "running", "relaxing"])  


Adding scenarios using the `by` method
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here we add the scenarios to the survey when we run it, together with any desired agents and models:

.. code-block:: python

  from edsl import QuestionLinearScale, QuestionFreeText, Survey

  q_enjoy = QuestionLinearScale(
      question_name = "enjoy",
      question_text = "On a scale from 1 to 5, how much do you enjoy {{ activity }}?",
      question_options = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
      option_labels = {1:"Not at all", 5:"Very much"}
  )

  q_favorite_place = QuestionFreeText(
      question_name = "favorite_place",
      question_text = "In a brief sentence, describe your favorite place for {{ activity }}."
  )

  survey = Survey([q_enjoy, q_favorite_place])

  results = survey.by(scenarios).by(agents).by(models).run()

  (
      results
      .filter("model.model == 'gpt-4o'")
      .sort_by("activity", "persona")
      .select("activity", "persona", "enjoy", "favorite_place")
  )


Example output:

.. list-table::
  :header-rows: 1

  * - scenario.activity
    - agent.persona
    - answer.enjoy
    - answer.favorite_place
  * - reading
    - artist
    - 4
    - My favorite place for reading is a cozy nook by a large window, where the natural light spills over the pages, surrounded by plants and the gentle hum of city life outside.
  * - reading

Adding scenarios using the `loop` method
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here we add scenarios to questions when constructing a survey, as opposed to when running it.
When we run the survey the results will include columns for each question and no `scenario` field. 
Note that we can also optionally use the scenario key in the question names (they are otherwise incremented by default):

.. code-block:: python

  from edsl import QuestionLinearScale, QuestionFreeText

  q_enjoy = QuestionLinearScale(
      question_name = "enjoy_{{ activity }}", # optional use of scenario key
      question_text = "On a scale from 1 to 5, how much do you enjoy {{ activity }}?",
      question_options = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
      option_labels = {1:"Not at all", 5:"Very much"}
  )

  q_favorite_place = QuestionFreeText(
      question_name = "favorite_place_{{ activity }}", # optional use of scenario key
      question_text = "In a brief sentence, describe your favorite place for {{ activity }}."
  )


Looping the scenarios to create a lists of versions of the `enjoy` question:

.. code-block:: python 

  enjoy_questions = q_enjoy.loop(scenarios)
  enjoy_questions


Output:

.. code_block:: python 

  [Question('linear_scale', question_name = """enjoy_reading""", question_text = """On a scale from 1 to 5, how much do you enjoy reading?""", question_options = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], option_labels = {1: 'Not at all', 5: 'Very much'}),
  Question('linear_scale', question_name = """enjoy_running""", question_text = """On a scale from 1 to 5, how much do you enjoy running?""", question_options = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], option_labels = {1: 'Not at all', 5: 'Very much'}),
  Question('linear_scale', question_name = """enjoy_relaxing""", question_text = """On a scale from 1 to 5, how much do you enjoy relaxing?""", question_options = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], option_labels = {1: 'Not at all', 5: 'Very much'})]


Looping the scenarios to create a lists of versions of the `favorite_place` question:

.. code-block:: python 

  favorite_place_questions = q_favorite_place.loop(scenarios)
  favorite_place_questions


Output:

.. code-block:: python 

  [Question('free_text', question_name = """favorite_place_reading""", question_text = """In a brief sentence, describe your favorite place for reading."""),
  Question('free_text', question_name = """favorite_place_running""", question_text = """In a brief sentence, describe your favorite place for running."""),
  Question('free_text', question_name = """favorite_place_relaxing""", question_text = """In a brief sentence, describe your favorite place for relaxing.""")]


Combining the questions into a survey and running it:

.. code-block:: python 

  survey = Survey(questions = enjoy_questions + favorite_place_questions)

  results = survey.by(agents).by(models).run()


We can see that there are additional question fields and no scenario fields:

.. code-block:: python

  results.columns


Output:

.. list-table::

Exploring `Results`
-------------------

EDSL comes with `built-in methods for analyzing and visualizing survey results <https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/language_models.html>`_. 
For example, you can call the `to_pandas` method to convert results into a dataframe:

.. code-block:: python 
    
    df = results.to_pandas(remove_prefix=True)
    # df # uncomment to view output


The `Results` object also supports SQL-like queries with the the `sql` method:

.. code-block:: python 

    results.sql("""
    select model, persona, enjoy_reading, favorite_place_reading
    from self
    order by 1,2,3
    """)


Output:

.. code-block:: text
