EDSL: AI-Powered Research
=========================

*Expected Parrot Domain-Specific Language* (EDSL) is an `open-source Python package <https://github.com/expectedparrot/edsl>`_ for conducting AI-powered research.
   
EDSL is developed by `Expected Parrot <https://www.expectedparrot.com>`_ and available under the MIT License.

This page provides documentation, tutorials and demo notebooks for the EDSL package and the `Coop <https://www.expectedparrot.com/explore>`_: a platform for creating, storing and sharing AI research. 
The contents are organized into key sections to help you get started.

- :ref:`surveys`: Construct surveys with rules and conditions.
- :ref:`agents`: Design AI agents with relevant traits to respond to surveys.
- :ref:`language_models`: Select language models to generate results.


Working with Results
--------------------

- :ref:`results`: Access built-in methods for analyzing survey results as datasets.
- :ref:`caching`: Learn about caching and sharing results.
- :ref:`exceptions`: Identify and handle exceptions in running surveys.
- :ref:`token_usage`: Monitor token limits and usage for language models.


Coop 
----

Coop is a platform for creating, storing and sharing EDSL content and AI-based research.

- :ref:`coop`: Learn how to create, store and share content at the Coop. 
- :ref:`survey_builder`: An interface for launching hybrid human-AI surveys.
- :ref:`filestore`: Store and share files for use in EDSL projects.
- :ref:`remote_inference`: Run surveys on the Expected Parrot server. 
- :ref:`remote_caching`: Automatically store survey results and API calls on the Expected Parrot server. 
- :ref:`notebooks`: Instructions for posting `.ipynb` files to the Coop. 


Importing Data
--------------

- :ref:`conjure`: Automatically import other survey data into EDSL to:
  
  * Clean and analyze your data
  * Create AI agents for respondents and conduct follow-on interviews
  * Extend your results with new questions and surveys
  * Store and share your data on the Coop


How-to Guides
-------------

Examples of special methods and use cases for EDSL, including:

- Data labeling
- Data cleaning
- Analyzing survey results 
- Adding data to surveys from CSVs, PDFs, images and other sources
- Conducting agent conversations
- Converting surveys into EDSL
- Cognitive testing 


Notebooks
---------

Templates and example code for using EDSL to conduct different kinds of research.
*We're happy to create a new notebook for your use case!*
