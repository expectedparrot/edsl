Expected Parrot: Tools for AI-Powered Research
==============================================

Expected Parrot delivers powerful tools for conducting research with human and artificial intelligences.

This page provides documentation for the **Expected Parrot Domain-Specific Language (EDSL)**, a Python package for performing research with AI agents and language models,
and **Coop**, a platform for creating, storing and sharing AI-based research projects.

* EDSL is available at `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/edsl/>`_ and `GitHub <https://github.com/expectedparrot/edsl>`_.
* Log in to `Coop <https://www.expectedparrot.com/login>`_ to access special features and `start collaborating <https://www.expectedparrot.com/content/explore>`_.


Key features 
------------

Simplified access to hundreds of models
   A single API key lets you conduct research with many popular models at once. `Learn more <https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/remote_inference.html>`_.

Collaboration made easy
   Use `Coop <https://www.expectedparrot.com/content/explore>`_ to create, store, and share your research projects seamlessly.

Data integrations
   Easily import, analyze and extend many types of data. `Learn more <https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/scenarios.html>`_.

Hybrid human-AI surveys
   Collect responses from both humans and AI. `Learn more <https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/survey_builder.html>`_.

Built-in analysis tools
   Analyze results with built-in methods. `Learn more <https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/results.html>`_.


Use cases 
---------

Our tools simplify survey creation, experiment execution and response analysis. 
Common use cases include:

Data labeling
   Use AI to answer qualitative and quantitative questions about your data, and extract insights. See `examples <https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/notebooks/data_labeling_example.html>`_.

Market research
   Gather insights on consumer preferences, behaviors and trends. Simulate customer personas with AI agents and analyze their responses. See `examples <https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/notebooks/yoga_studio_name_survey.html>`_.

User experience research
   Assess user satisfaction, usability and engagement. Use AI agents to simulate user profiles and analyze their feedback on products or services. See `examples <https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/notebooks/nps_survey.html>`_.

Integrate human and AI data
   Combine human responses with AI-generated responses to create richer datasets. See `examples <https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/notebooks/import_agents.html>`_.

Analyze survey data
   Analyze survey data with built-in methods. Simulate follow-up interviews with respondents. See `examples <https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/notebooks/analyze_evaluations.html>`_.

Social science research
   Explore hypotheses, gather qualitative or quantitative data and generate new data using AI.

Getting started 
---------------

*Technical setup:*

1. Install the EDSL package. See :ref:`installation` instructions.

2. Log in to `Coop <https://www.expectedparrot.com/login>`_ to access special features for working with AI agents and language models, storage and collaboration tools.

3. Choose how to access language models: 
   
   * **Remote:** Use your Expected Parrot API key to access models at Coop. See instructions on activating :ref:`remote_inference` and purchasing `credits <https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/credits.html>`_.
   * **Local:** Use your own API keys for models to use on your own machine. See instructions on storing :ref:`api_keys`.
