Expected Parrot: Tools for AI-Powered Research
==============================================

Expected Parrot delivers powerful tools for conducting research with human and artificial intelligences.

This page provides documentation for **Expected Parrot Domain-Specific Language (EDSL)**, an open-source Python package for performing research with AI agents and language models,
and **Coop**, a platform for creating, storing and sharing AI research projects, and validating LLM results with human respondents.

* EDSL is available to download from `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/edsl/>`_ (run `pip install edsl`). The source code is available at `GitHub <https://github.com/expectedparrot/edsl>`_.
* `Create an account <https://www.expectedparrot.com/login>`_ to post and share content, run surveys with LLMs and humans, and store results at the Expected Parrot server. Learn more about `how it works <https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/coop.html>`_ and start `exploring <https://www.expectedparrot.com/content/explore>`_.


Key features 
------------

Simplified access to hundreds of models
   A single API key lets you conduct research with many popular models at once. `Learn more <https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/remote_inference.html>`_.

Collaboration features
   Use `Coop <https://www.expectedparrot.com/login>`_ to create, store and share your research projects seamlessly.

Data integrations
   Easily import, analyze and extend many types of data to use with your research. `Learn more <https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/scenarios.html>`_.

Hybrid human-AI surveys
   Collect and combine responses from humans and AI. `Learn more <https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/humanize.html>`_.

Built-in analysis tools
   Readily visualize, analyze and compare responses. `Learn more <https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/results.html>`_.


Use cases 
---------

Our tools simplify survey creation, experiment execution and response analysis. 
Common use cases include:

Data labeling
   Use AI to answer qualitative and quantitative questions about your data, and extract insights. See `examples <https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/notebooks/data_labeling_example.html>`_.

Market research
   Gather insights on consumer preferences, behaviors and trends. Simulate customer personas with AI agents and analyze their responses. See `examples <https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/notebooks/yoga_studio_name_survey.html>`_.

User experience research
   Assess user satisfaction, usability and engagement. Use AI agents to simulate user profiles and analyze their feedback on products or services. See `examples <https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/notebooks/nps_survey.html>`_.

Integrate human and AI data
   Combine human responses with AI-generated responses to create richer datasets. See `examples <https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/notebooks/import_agents.html>`_.

Analyze survey data
   Analyze survey data with built-in methods. Simulate follow-up interviews with respondents. See `examples <https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/notebooks/analyze_evaluations.html>`_.

Compare model performance 
   Compare the performance of different language models on the same task. See `examples <https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/notebooks/models_scoring_models.html>`_.
   
Social science research
   Explore hypotheses, gather qualitative or quantitative data and generate new data using AI.

Getting started 
---------------

To use EDSL, you need to install the package and choose how to access language models.
Please see the links in the steps below for more details:

1. **Install EDSL** 
   
   Run the following command to install the package:

   .. code:: 

      pip show edsl


   See :ref:`installation` instructions for more details.

2. **Create a Coop account** 

   `Create an account <https://www.expectedparrot.com/login>`_ to access the Expected Parrot server, free storage and special features and collaboration tools.

3. **Manage API keys for language models**

   Your account comes with a key that allows you to run surveys with all available models at the Expected Parrot server.
   You can also use and share your own keys from service providers.

   See instructions on :ref:`api_keys` for details and options.

4. **Run a survey.** 

   Read the :ref:`starter_tutorial` and `download a notebook <https://www.expectedparrot.com/content/179b3a78-2505-4568-acd9-c09d18953288>`_ to create a survey and run it.
   See examples for many use cases and `tips <https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/checklist.html>`_ on using EDSL effectively in the documentation.

5. **Validate with real respondents.**

   You can run surveys with real respondents using the Coop platform or at your workspace.
   Learn about methods for generating web-based surveys and collecting responses in the :ref:`survey_builder` and :ref:`humanize` sections.
