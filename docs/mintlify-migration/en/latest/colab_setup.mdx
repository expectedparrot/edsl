To run them in Colab, please follow the special instructions below for technical setup:

## 1. Store your API key as a secret

In Google Colab, your API keys can be stored as “secrets” in lieu of storing them in a *.env* file as you would in other notebook types.

For example, you can store your Expected Parrot API key as follows:

</Frame>

## 2. Install EDSL

Run the following command in a code cell to install the EDSL package:

```bash
pip install edsl
```

## 3. Access your API key

Run the following code to access your API key in your Colab notebook:

```python
import os
from google.colab import userdata

os.environ['EXPECTED_PARROT_API_KEY'] = userdata.get('EXPECTED_PARROT_API_KEY')
```

## Example Colab code

EDSL methods for creating objects and posting them to the Coop are now available to you in Colab.

Here’s a snapshot of how your Colab code might look:
