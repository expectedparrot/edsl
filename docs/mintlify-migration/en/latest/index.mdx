This page provides documentation for **Expected Parrot Domain-Specific Language (EDSL)**, an open-source Python package for performing research with AI agents and language models, and **Coop**, a platform for creating, storing and sharing AI research projects, and validating LLM results with human respondents.

- EDSL is available to download from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/edsl/) (run pip install edsl). The source code is available at [GitHub](https://github.com/expectedparrot/edsl).
- [Create an account](https://www.expectedparrot.com/login) to post and share content, run surveys with LLMs and humans, and store results at the Expected Parrot server. Learn more about [how it works](/en/latest/coop) and start [exploring](https://www.expectedparrot.com/content/explore).

## Key features

**Simplified access to hundreds of models**

	- A single API key lets you conduct research with many popular models at once. [Learn more](/en/latest/remote_inference).

**Collaboration features**

	- Use [Coop](https://www.expectedparrot.com/login) to create, store and share your research projects seamlessly.

**Data integrations**

	- Easily import, analyze and extend many types of data to use with your research. [Learn more](/en/latest/scenarios).

**Hybrid human-AI surveys**

	- Collect and combine responses from humans and AI. [Learn more](/en/latest/humanize).

**Built-in analysis tools**

	- Readily visualize, analyze and compare responses. [Learn more](/en/latest/results).

## Use cases

Our tools simplify survey creation, experiment execution and response analysis. Common use cases include:

**Data labeling**

	- Use AI to answer qualitative and quantitative questions about your data, and extract insights. See [examples](/en/latest/notebooks/data_labeling_example).

**Market research**

	- Gather insights on consumer preferences, behaviors and trends. Simulate customer personas with AI agents and analyze their responses. See [examples](/en/latest/notebooks/yoga_studio_name_survey).

**User experience research**

	- Assess user satisfaction, usability and engagement. Use AI agents to simulate user profiles and analyze their feedback on products or services. See [examples](/en/latest/notebooks/nps_survey).

**Integrate human and AI data**

	- Combine human responses with AI-generated responses to create richer datasets. See [examples](/en/latest/notebooks/import_agents).

**Analyze survey data**

	- Analyze survey data with built-in methods. Simulate follow-up interviews with respondents. See [examples](/en/latest/notebooks/analyze_evaluations).

**Compare model performance**

	- Compare the performance of different language models on the same task. See [examples](/en/latest/notebooks/models_scoring_models).

**Social science research**

	- Explore hypotheses, gather qualitative or quantitative data and generate new data using AI.

## Getting started

To use EDSL, you need to install the package and choose how to access language models. Please see the links in the steps below for more details:

<Steps>
<Step title="Install EDSL">
	Run the following command to install the package:
	```bash
	! uv pip install edsl -q
	```
	See [Installation](/en/latest/installation) instructions for more details.
</Step>
<Step title="Create a Coop account">
	Create an account](https://www.expectedparrot.com/login) to access the Expected Parrot server, free storage and special features and collaboration tools.
	You can also log into Expected Parrot and import dependencies by running:
	```python
	from edsl import Login
	login()
	```
</Step>
<Step title="Manage API keys for language models">
	Your account comes with a key that allows you to run surveys with all [available models](https://www.expectedparrot.com/models). You can also provide and share your own keys from service providers.
	See instructions on [Managing Keys](/en/latest/api_keys) for details and options.
</Step>
<Step title="Run a survey">
	Read the [Starter Tutorial](/en/latest/starter_tutorial) and [download a notebook](https://www.expectedparrot.com/content/179b3a78-2505-4568-acd9-c09d18953288) to create a survey and run it. See examples for many use cases and [tips](/en/latest/checklist) on using EDSL effectively in the documentation.
</Step>
<Step title="Validate with real respondents">
	Choose when to add a human-in-the-loop by automatically launching a web-based survey to share with real respondents. Learn about collecting responses in the [Survey Builder](/en/latest/survey_builder) and [Humanize](/en/latest/humanize) sections.
