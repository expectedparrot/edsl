title: "Run a job in the background"
description: "You can run a remote survey in the background by passing a parameter `background=True` to the `run()` method. This allows you to continue working (or stop working) while your survey job completes."
---

You can check the progress of the job by opening the **Progress Bar** page view, and use the **Job UUID** to identify the job at your Coop account. If you also passed a `remote_inference_description` and/or `remote_inference_visibility` setting to the `run()` method (as we do below) you can also use those to identify the job at Coop. See the Job UUID and URL that are returned in the job status table (this table is returned when any job is run remotely). Note that the Results UUID and Results URL are *not* automatically updated when the job completes:

```python
from edsl import QuestionFreeText, Model

m = Model("gemini-1.5-flash")

q = QuestionFreeText(
    question_name = "poem",
    question_text = "Please write me a heartfelt poem for Valentine's Day."
)

r = q.by(m).run(
    background = True, # optional
    remote_inference_description = "A poem for Valentine's Day", # optional
    remote_inference_results_visibility = "public" # optional
)
```

## Status updates

You can also check for updates by calling the `fetch()` method on the results object that you are generating. By default, this will check for results once every second. You can specify a different polling interval by passing the number of seconds for the interval.

For example, while the job above is running we check for results every 2.0 seconds until they are returned:

```python

r.fetch(polling_interval = 2.0)
```

| 0 | The world is hushed, a winter's grace, But in my heart, a sunlit space. Where thoughts of you, a warming fire, Ignite a love, a pure desire. No diamond's gleam, no rose's hue, Can match the joy I find in you. Your laughter's song, a sweet refrain, Erases sorrow, heals all pain. Your gentle touch, a whispered plea, Awakens depths I long to see. Within your eyes, a universe, Where love's own story finds its verse. So let this day, with hearts entwined, A testament to love we find. A bond so strong, a sacred vow, My love for you, I pledge it now.

Now we can select and analyze the results as usual:

```python
r.select("model", "answer.*")
```

Here we post/update this notebook at Coop:

```python

from edsl import Notebook

nb = Notebook(path = "run_background.ipynb")

if refresh := False:
    nb.push(
        description = "Run a remote survey in the background",
        alias = "run-background-notebook",
        visibility = "public"
    )
else:
    nb.patch("https://www.expectedparrot.com/content/RobinHorton/run-background-notebook", value = nb)
```
