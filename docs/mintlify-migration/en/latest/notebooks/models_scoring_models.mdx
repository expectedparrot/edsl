title: "Comparing model performance"
description: "In this notebook we show how to use EDSL to prompt a set of models to answer the same survey at once and compare their responses."
---

We also demonstrate how to prompt models to evaluate the content they have generated.

```python
from edsl import Model, ModelList, ScenarioList, QuestionFreeText, QuestionLinearScale, Survey
```

```python
m = ModelList([
    Model("claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219", service_name = "anthropic"),
    Model("gemini-1.5-flash", service_name = "google"),
    Model("gpt-4o", service_name = "openai")
])
```

```python
s = ScenarioList.from_source("list", "topic", ["winter", "language models"])
```

```python
q1 = QuestionFreeText(
    question_name = "haiku",
    question_text = "Please draft a haiku about `{{ scenario.topic }}`."
)

q2 = QuestionLinearScale(
    question_name = "originality",
    question_text = "On a scale from 1 to 5, please rate the originality of this haiku: `{{ haiku.answer }}`.",
    question_options = [1,2,3,4,5],
    option_labels = {1:"Totally unoriginal", 5:"Highly original"}
)

survey = Survey(questions = [q1, q2])

survey
```

[Survey](/en/latest/surveys) # questions: 2; question_name list: ['haiku', 'originality'];

|  | option_labels | question_text | question_name | question_options | question_type |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0 | nan | Please draft a haiku about `{{ scenario.topic }}`. | haiku | nan | free_text |
| 1 | `{1: 'Totally unoriginal', 5: 'Highly original'}` | On a scale from 1 to 5, please rate the originality of this haiku: `{{ haiku.answer }}`. | originality | [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] | linear_scale |

```python
results = survey.by(s).by(m).run()
```

```python
results.select("model", "topic", "haiku", "originality")
```

|  | model.model | scenario.topic | answer.haiku | answer.originality |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0 | claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219 | winter | Snowflakes drift downward Blanket of white hides the earth Silence embraces | 2 |
| 1 | gemini-1.5-flash | winter | White breath in the air, Frozen ground crunches below, Silence blankets all. | 2 |
| 2 | gpt-4o | winter | Snow blankets the earth, Silent whispers fill the air, Cold breath of winter. | 2 |
| 3 | claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219 | language models | Words dance in code, Patterns weave through silicon— Echoes of our thoughts. | 4 |
| 4 | gemini-1.5-flash | language models | Data flows like streams, Words bloom, a digital flower, Meaning takes its form. | 2 |
| 5 | gpt-4o | language models | Words dance in silence, Patterns weave through vast data— Machines learn to speak. | 4 |

## Next we prompt each model to rate every haiku

We modify the second question to use a scenario for each haiku instead of piping the answer from the first question (i.e., `{{ haiku.answer }}` is changed to `{{ scenario.haiku }}`):

```python
new_q = QuestionLinearScale(
    question_name = "originality",
    question_text = "On a scale from 1 to 5, please rate the originality of this haiku: `{{ scenario.haiku }}`.",
    question_options = [1,2,3,4,5],
    option_labels = {1:"Totally unoriginal", 5:"Highly original"}
)
```

```python
haikus = results.select("model", "topic", "haiku").to_scenario_list().rename({"model":"drafting_model"})
haikus
```

[ScenarioList](/en/latest/scenarios) scenarios: 6; keys: ['haiku', 'drafting_model', 'topic'];

| 5 | gpt-4o | language models | Words dance in silence, Patterns weave through vast data— Machines learn to speak. |

```python
new_results = new_q.by(haikus).by(m).run()
```

```python
(
    new_results
    .sort_by("topic", "drafting_model", "model")
    .select("model", "drafting_model", "topic", "haiku", "originality")
)
```
