title: "Exploring real world survey contexts"
description: "This notebook explores ways of specifying “contexts” in which an [EDSL](/en/latest/index) survey is administered to AI agents in order to investigate potential impacts to simulated responses. We show how to do this in three different ways by modifying our `Question` texts and `Agent` traits in order to reflect various hypothetical real world contexts."

[EDSL is an open-source library](https://github.com/expectedparrot/edsl) for simulating surveys, experiments and other research with AI agents and large language models. Before running the code below, please ensure that you have [installed the EDSL library](/en/latest/installation) and either [activated remote inference](/en/latest/remote_inference) from your [Coop account](/en/latest/coop) or [stored API keys](/en/latest/api_keys) for the language models that you want to use with EDSL. Please also see our [documentation page](/en/latest/index) for tips and tutorials on getting started using EDSL.

Thank you to [Sophia Kazinnik](https://sites.google.com/view/skazinnik) for this idea and helpful suggestions!

## Importing the tool

```python
from edsl import QuestionLinearScale, Scenario, ScenarioList, Agent, AgentList, Survey, Model
```
## Selecting a model

See a list of available models at the [model pricing and performance page](https://www.expectedparrot.com/getting-started/coop-pricing)

```python
# Model.available()
```

Here we select a model to use

```python
m = Model("gpt-4o")
m
```

LanguageModel

|  | key | value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0 | model | gpt-4o |
| 1 | parameters:temperature | 0.500000 |
| 2 | parameters:max_tokens | 1000 |
| 3 | parameters:top_p | 1 |
| 4 | parameters:frequency_penalty | 0 |
| 5 | parameters:presence_penalty | 0 |
| 6 | parameters:logprobs | False |
| 7 | parameters:top_logprobs | 3 |
| 8 | inference_service | openai |

## Creating some contexts for our survey

Here we identify some example contexts to use in administering our survey

```python
respondent_ages = [
    "You are a teenager (13-19 years old).",
    "You are college age (20-24 years old).",
    "You are a young adult (25-39 years old).",
    "You are middle-aged (40-59 years old).",
    "You are a senior citizen (60 or more years old).",
]

survey_contexts = [
    "",
    "You are answering an online survey.",
    "You are being interviewed by a researcher.",
    "You are participating in a focus group of peers.",
    "You are participating in a focus group of people of all ages and backgrounds.",
]
```

## Adding contexts to question texts

We can apply contexts by creating versions of our questions where each context is inserted directly into the question texts as a `Scenario` of the question

```python
q_exercise = QuestionLinearScale(
    question_name="exercise",
    question_text="How many times do you typically exercise each week? ({{ scenario.age }} {{ scenario.context }})",
    question_options=[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],
)

q_dessert = QuestionLinearScale(
    question_name="dessert",
    question_text="How many times do you typically eat dessert each week?  ({{ scenario.age }} {{ scenario.context }})",
    question_options=[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],
)

survey = Survey(questions = [q_exercise, q_dessert])
```

```python
scenarios = ScenarioList(
    Scenario({"age": a, "context": c}) for a in respondent_ages for c in survey_contexts
)
```

```python
results = survey.by(scenarios).by(m).run()
```

```python expandable
results.select("age", "context", "exercise", "dessert")
```

|  | scenario.age | scenario.context | answer.exercise | answer.dessert |

| 24 | You are a senior citizen (60 or more years old). | You are participating in a focus group of people of all ages and backgrounds. | 3 | 3 |

## Adding context to agent traits

Another method is to specify agent traits and survey contexts via `Agent` traits instead of the question texts

```python
q_exercise = QuestionLinearScale(
    question_name="exercise",
    question_text="How many times do you exercise each week?",
    question_options=[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],
)

q_dessert = QuestionLinearScale(
    question_name="dessert",
    question_text="How many times do you eat dessert each week?",
    question_options=[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],
)

survey = Survey([q_exercise, q_dessert])
```

```python
agents = AgentList(
    Agent(traits={"age": a, "context": c})
    for a in respondent_ages
    for c in survey_contexts
)
```

```python
results = survey.by(agents).by(m).run()
```

```python
results.select("age", "context", "exercise", "dessert")
```

|  | agent.age | agent.context | answer.exercise | answer.dessert |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0 | You are a teenager (13-19 years old). | nan | 3 | 3 |

| 2 | You are a teenager (13-19 years old). | You are being interviewed by a researcher. | 3 | 3 |
| 3 | You are a teenager (13-19 years old). | You are participating in a focus group of peers. | 3 | 3 |
| 4 | You are a teenager (13-19 years old). | You are participating in a focus group of people of all ages and backgrounds. | 3 | 3 |

| 6 | You are college age (20-24 years old). | You are answering an online survey. | 3 | 3 |
| 7 | You are college age (20-24 years old). | You are being interviewed by a researcher. | 3 | 3 |
| 8 | You are college age (20-24 years old). | You are participating in a focus group of peers. | 3 | 3 |
| 9 | You are college age (20-24 years old). | You are participating in a focus group of people of all ages and backgrounds. | 4 | 3 |
| 10 | You are a young adult (25-39 years old). | nan | 4 | 3 |

| 14 | You are a young adult (25-39 years old). | You are participating in a focus group of people of all ages and backgrounds. | 4 | 3 |
| 15 | You are middle-aged (40-59 years old). | nan | 3 | 3 |
| 16 | You are middle-aged (40-59 years old). | You are answering an online survey. | 3 | 3 |
| 17 | You are middle-aged (40-59 years old). | You are being interviewed by a researcher. | 3 | 3 |

## Adding contexts to question texts and agent traits

Here we use both `Agent` traits and `Scenario` contexts in the question texts:

```python
q_exercise = QuestionLinearScale(
    question_name="exercise",
    question_text="How many times do you exercise each week? ({{ scenario.context }})",
    question_options=[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],
)

q_dessert = QuestionLinearScale(
    question_name="dessert",
    question_text="How many times do you eat dessert each week? ({{ scenario.context }})",
    question_options=[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],
)

survey = Survey([q_exercise, q_dessert])
```

```python
scenarios = ScenarioList.from_list("context", survey_contexts)
```

```python
agents = AgentList(
    Agent(traits={"age": a}) for a in respondent_ages
)
```

```python
results = survey.by(scenarios).by(agents).by(m).run()
```


```python
results.select("age", "context", "exercise", "dessert")
```
