title: "Data labeling agents"
description: "This notebook shows how to conduct data labeling tasks using [EDSL](/en/latest/index), an open-source library for simulating surveys, experiments and other research with AI agents and large language models."
---

This workflow consists of the following steps:

<Steps>
<Step>
    Import data into EDSL
</Step>
<Step>
    Create questions about the data
</Step>
<Step>
    Design an AI agent to answer the questions
</Step>
<Step>
    Select a language model to generate responses
</Step>
<Step>
    Analyze results as a formatted dataset
</Step>
</Steps>

This workflow can be visualized as follows:

![general_survey.png](/images/en/notebook/general_survey.png)
</Frame>

## Conducting agent-specific tasks

We can add a layer of complexity to this generalized flow by creating different AI agents for subsets of the data to be reviewed. For example, we can design agents with specific “expertise” to review only the data that is relevant to that expertise. This can be useful if our data is sorted (or sortable) in some way that is important to our task. We can also use EDSL to prompt a language model to sort the data as needed.

This modified workflow can be visualized as follows:

</Frame>

## Example task: Evaluating job posts

Using a dataset of job posts as an example, in the steps below we create AI agents with expertise in the relevant job categories and then prompt them to evaluate relevant job posts in a variety of ways. The steps are:

<Steps>
    <Step>
    Import a [dataset](/en/latest/scenarios) of job categories and job posts.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Construct [questions](/en/latest/questions) about the job posts and combine them in a [survey](/en/latest/surveys).
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Design [AI agents](/en/latest/agents) with job category expertise.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Administer the survey to each agent with job posts for the relevant category.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Inspect the [results](/en/latest/results) using built-in methods for analysis.
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Validating results

EDSL also provides methods for launching your surveys with human respondents to compare and validate LLM results. [Learn more](/en/latest/humanize) about these features.

## Technical setup

Before running the code below please see instructions on [getting started](https://www.expectedparrot.com/getting-started). An introductory [data labeling example notebook](/en/latest/notebooks/data_labeling_example) is also available at our [documentation page](/en/latest).

## Import the tools

We start by selecting question types and survey components that we will use. Please see the [EDSL Docs](/en/latest/index) for examples of all [question types](/en/latest/questions) and details on these basic components.

```python
from edsl import (
    QuestionMultipleChoice, QuestionList, QuestionNumerical,
    Survey, ScenarioList, AgentList, Agent, Model
)
```

## Import data

Next we import a dataset for review, using `Scenario` objects to represent the individual data that will be added to each of our data labeling questions. EDSL allows us to create data or [import it from other sources](/en/latest/scenarios) (CSV, PDF, PNG, MP4, DOC, tables, lists, dicts, etc.).

For purposes of demonstration, we create a dataframe, post it to Coop with the `FileStore` module and then retrieve it. Note that `FileStore` works with many file types and automatically infers the file type. [Learn more](/en/latest/filestore) about posting and retrieving files.

```python
df.to_csv("data.csv")
```

Here we post the file to Coop and get the information for the object:

```python
from edsl import FileStore

fs = FileStore("data.csv")

fs.push(
    description = "Example CSV file: Job categories",
    alias = "filestore-csv-example",
    visibility = "public"
)
```

```json
{'description': 'Example CSV file: Job categories',
 'object_type': 'scenario',
 'url': 'https://www.expectedparrot.com/content/00b84308-166e-4828-9a3a-04cb93cd3222',
 'alias_url': 'https://www.expectedparrot.com/content/RobinHorton/filestore-csv-example',

```

Next we retrieve the data file and use it to create scenarios (replace this code with the UUID of any file you want to use):

```python
from edsl import FileStore, ScenarioList

fs = FileStore.pull("https://www.expectedparrot.com/content/RobinHorton/filestore-csv-example")

scenarios = ScenarioList.from_source("csv", fs.to_tempfile())

## Construct questions about the data

Next we construct questions to ask about the job posts, selecting question types based on the form of the response that we want to get back from the language model (multiple choice, linear scale, free text, numerical, etc.–see [examples of all question types](/en/latest/questions)). We include a `{{ placeholder }}` for the scenario keys in order to parameterize each question with each job post and category when we run the survey:

```python expandable
q_skills = QuestionList(
    question_name="skills",
    question_text="""
    Consider the following job category and job post at an online labor marketplace.
    Job category: `{{ scenario.job_category }}
    Job post: {{ scenario.job_post }}
    What are some key skills required for this job?
    """,
)

q_experience = QuestionMultipleChoice(
    question_name="experience",
    question_text="""
    Consider the following job category and job post at an online labor marketplace.
    Job category: {{ scenario.job_category }}
    Job post: {{ scenario.job_post }}
    What level of experience is required for this job?
    """,
    question_options=["Entry-level", "Mid-level", "Senior-level"],
)

q_days = QuestionNumerical(
    question_name="days",
    question_text="""
    Consider the following job category and job post at an online labor marketplace.
    Job category: {{ scenario.job_category }}
    Job post: {{ scenario.job_post }}
    Estimate the number of days until this job post is fulfilled.
    """,
)
```

## Combining questions into a Survey

Next we combine our questions into a survey that will be administered to the AI agents. By default, the questions will be administered asynchronously. If desired, we can also specify survey rules (skip/stop logic) and within-survey memories of prior questions and responses. See the EDSL Docs for details on methods for [applying survey rules](/en/latest/surveys#applying-survey-rules).

```python
survey = Survey(questions=[q_skills, q_experience, q_days])
```

## Creating personas for Agents

Next we draft personas for AI agents that will answer the questions. For each job category we construct an AI agent that is an expert in the category. Agents are constructed by passing a dictionary of `traits` to an `Agent` object. [Learn more about designing AI agents](/en/latest/agents) to answer surveys.

To get the set of job categories from the scenarios:

```python
job_categories = list(set(scenarios.select("job_category").to_list()))
job_categories
```
```
['Digital Marketing', 'Web Development', 'Graphic Design', 'Content Writing']
```

Next we use them to create an agent for each job category:

```python
agents = AgentList(
    Agent(
        traits = {
            "persona": "You are an experienced freelancer on online labor marketplaces.",
            "job_category": job_category,
            "expertise": f"You regularly perform jobs in the following category: {job_category}."
        }
    ) for job_category in job_categories
)
agents
```
```
AgentList agents: 4;
```

|  | persona | job_category | expertise |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0 | You are an experienced freelancer on online labor marketplaces. | Digital Marketing | You regularly perform jobs in the following category: Digital Marketing. |
| 1 | You are an experienced freelancer on online labor marketplaces. | Web Development | You regularly perform jobs in the following category: Web Development. |
| 2 | You are an experienced freelancer on online labor marketplaces. | Graphic Design | You regularly perform jobs in the following category: Graphic Design. |
| 3 | You are an experienced freelancer on online labor marketplaces. | Content Writing | You regularly perform jobs in the following category: Content Writing. |

## Selecting language models

EDSL works with many popular language models that we can select to generate the agents’ responses to the survey. Information about current models is [available here](https://www.expectedparrot.com/models). To check a list of service providers:


```python
Model.services()
```


|  | Service Name |
| :--- | :--- |
| 0 | anthropic |
| 1 | azure |
| 2 | bedrock |
| 3 | deep_infra |
| 4 | deepseek |
| 5 | google |
| 6 | groq |
| 7 | mistral |
| 8 | ollama |
| 9 | openai |
| 10 | openai_v2 |
| 11 | perplexity |
| 12 | together |
| 13 | xai |

Here we specify a model to use to generate responses (if we do not specify a model, GPT-4o is used by default):


```python
model = Model("gemini-1.5-flash", service_name = "google")
```

## Running the survey

We administer a survey by appending the components with the `by()` method and then calling `run()` method. In the simplest case where we want a single agent or list of agents to answer all questions with the same scenarios, this takes the following form:

```python
results = survey.by(scenarios).by(agents).by(models).run()
```

Here we have individual agents answer the questions only for category-specific job posts, and then combine the results:


```python expandable
results = None

for job_category in job_categories:
    print("nnJob category: ", job_category)

    # Create an agent for the job category
    a = agents.filter(f"job_category == '{job_category}'")

    # Filter the relevant scenarios
    s = scenarios.filter(f"job_category == '{job_category}'")

    # Run the survey with the agent and scenarios
    job_category_results = survey.by(s).by(a).run()

    # Store the results
    if results == None:
        results = job_category_results

    else:
        results = results + job_category_results

Job category:  Digital Marketing
```

## Accessing Results

In the previous step we created `Results` for individual agents’ responses and combined them. Next we show how to inspect and analyze results with built-in methods.

We can identify the column names to select the fields that we want to inspect:

```python
results.columns

/Users/a16174/edsl/edsl/results/result.py:382: UserWarning: Key 'job_category' of data type 'scenario' is already in use. Renaming to job_category_scenario

    .filter("job_category == 'Graphic Design'")
    .select("job_post", "skills", "experience", "days")
)
