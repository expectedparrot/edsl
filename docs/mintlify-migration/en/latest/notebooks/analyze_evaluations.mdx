title: "Analyzing course evaluations"
description: "This notebook provides sample [EDSL](https://pypi.org/project/edsl/) code for using a language model to analyze course evaluations. The analysis is designed as a survey of questions about a set of evaluations that we prompt an AI agent to answer, using a language model to generate the responses as a dataset."
---

[EDSL is an open-source library](https://github.com/expectedparrot/edsl) for simulating surveys, experiments and other research with AI agents and large language models. Before running the code below, please see instructions on [getting started](https://www.expectedparrot.com/getting-started), and tips and tutorials at our [documentation page](/en/latest/index).

## Create questions

We start by creating questions about a set of course evaluations for an agent to answer. EDSL comes with a [variety of question types](/en/latest/questions) that we can choose from based on the form of the response that we want to get back from a model (multiple choice, linear scale, checkbox, free text, numerical, dictionary, etc.). We can use a `{{ placeholder }}` in the question texts to parameterize them with each evaluation. This allows us to create different “scenarios” of the questions that we can administer at once.

We start by importing some question types and composing questions in the relevant templates (see [examples of all types](/en/latest/questions#question-type-classes) in the docs):

```python expandable
from edsl import QuestionList, QuestionMultipleChoice

q_sentiment = QuestionMultipleChoice(
    question_name="sentiment",
    question_text="What is the overall sentiment of this evaluation: {{ scenario.evaluation }}",
    question_options=["Positive", "Neutral", "Negative"],
)

q_themes = QuestionList(
    question_name="themes",
    question_text="Summarize the key points of this evaluation: {{ scenario.evaluation }}",
    max_list_items=3,  # Optional
)

q_improvements = QuestionList(
    question_name="improvements",
    question_text="Identify areas for improvement based on this evaluation: {{ scenario.evaluation }}",
    max_list_items=3,
)
```

## Construct a survey

Next we combine our questions into a survey. This allows us to administer the questions asynchronously (by default), or according to any desired [survey logic or rules](/en/latest/surveys) that we want to add, such as skip/stop rules or giving an agent “memories” of other questions in the survey. Here we create a simple asynchronous survey by passing the list of questions to a `Survey` object:

```python
from edsl import Survey

survey = Survey(questions=[q_sentiment, q_themes, q_improvements])

survey
```
```
Survey # questions: 3; question_name list: ['sentiment', 'themes', 'improvements'];
```

|  | question_options | question_name | question_text | question_type | max_list_items |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0 | ['Positive', 'Neutral', 'Negative'] | sentiment | What is the overall sentiment of this evaluation: {`{ scenario.evaluation }`} | multiple_choice | nan |
| 1 | nan | themes | Summarize the key points of this evaluation: {`{ scenario.evaluation }`} | list | 3.000000 |
| 2 | nan | improvements | Identify areas for improvement based on this evaluation: {`{ scenario.evaluation }`} | list | 3.000000 |

## Add data to the questions

Next we identify the data to be analyzed and create `Scenario` objects for it. This allows us to efficiently readminister questions with different data. We can create data using EDSL or [import it from other sources](/en/latest/scenarios) (CSV, PDF, PNG, MP4, DOC, tables, lists, dicts, etc.). Here we use some mock evaluations for an Econ 101 course stored as a list of texts:

```python expandable
evaluations = [
    "I found the course very engaging and informative. The professor did an excellent job breaking down complex concepts, making them accessible to those of us new to economics. However, the pace was a bit fast, and I sometimes struggled to keep up with the weekly readings.",
    "This class was a struggle for me. The material felt dry and difficult to connect with real-world applications, which I think could have made it more interesting. More examples from current events would definitely have helped spark my interest.",
    "Excellent introductory course! The professor was enthusiastic and always willing to offer extra help during office hours. The interactive lectures and the practical assignments made the theory much more digestible and engaging.",
    "As someone with a strong background in math, I appreciated the analytical rigor of this course. However, I wish there had been more discussions that connected the theories we learned to everyday economic issues. It felt a bit isolated from practical realities at times.",
    "I enjoyed the course, especially the group projects, which were both challenging and rewarding. It was great to apply economic concepts to solve real-life problems. I did feel, however, that the feedback on assignments could be more detailed to help us understand our mistakes.",
    "The course content was well-organized, but the lectures were somewhat monotonous and hard to follow. I would suggest incorporating more visual aids and maybe some guest lectures from industry professionals to liven up the sessions.",
    "This was my favorite class this semester! The mix of theory and case studies was perfect, and the exams were fair. I also really appreciated the diversity of perspectives we explored in class, especially in terms of global economic policies.",
    "I found the textbook to be overly complex for an introductory course. It often used jargon that hadn't been explained in lectures, which was confusing. Simpler reading materials or more explanatory lectures would make a big difference for newcomers to economics.",
    "The professor was knowledgeable and clearly passionate about economics, but I felt the course relied too heavily on tests rather than more creative forms of assessment. More varied assignments would make the course more accessible to students with different learning styles.",
    "This class was a solid introduction to economics, though it leaned heavily on theoretical aspects. I would have liked more opportunities to discuss the real-world implications of economic theories, which I believe would enhance understanding and retention of the material.",
]
```

```python
from edsl import ScenarioList

scenarios = ScenarioList.from_source("list", "evaluation", evaluations)
```

## Design AI agents

Next we design agents with relevant traits and personas for a language model to use in answering the questions. This can be useful if we want to compare responses among different audiences. We do this by passing dictionaries of `traits` to `Agent` objects. We can also choose whether to give an agent additional instructions for answering the survey (independent of individual question texts). Please see documentation for more [details and example code for creating agents to use with surveys](/en/latest/agents).

Here we create a persona for the professor of the course and pass it some special instructions:

```python
from edsl import Agent

persona = "You are a professor reviewing student evaluations for your recent Econ 101 course."
instruction = "Be very specific and constructive in providing feedback and suggestions."

agent = Agent(traits={"persona": persona}, instruction=instruction)
```

## Select language models

[EDSL works with many popular language models](/en/latest/language_models) that we can use to generate responses for our survey. A current list of available models, performance and pricing is available [here](https://www.expectedparrot.com/models).

We select models to use with a survey by creating `Model` objects for them (if no model is specified, gpt-4o is currently used by default):

```python
from edsl import Model

model = Model("gemini-1.5-flash", service_name = "google")
model
```
```
gemini-1.5-flash
```

|  | key | value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0 | model | gemini-1.5-flash |
| 1 | parameters:temperature | 0.500000 |
| 2 | parameters:topP | 1 |
| 3 | parameters:topK | 1 |
| 4 | parameters:maxOutputTokens | 2048 |
| 5 | parameters:stopSequences | [] |
| 6 | inference_service | google |

## Run the survey

Next we add the scenarios and agent to the survey, and then run it with the specified model. This will generate a dataset of `Results` that we can store and begin analyzing:

```python
results = survey.by(scenarios).by(agent).by(model).run()
```

## Analyzing results

EDSL comes with [built-in methods for analyzing results](/en/latest/results) in data tables, dataframes, SQL queries and other formats. We can print a list of all the components that can be accessed:

```python
results.columns
```

Here we select just the responses to the questions and display them in a table:

```python
results.select("sentiment", "themes", "themes_generated_tokens", "improvements")
```

|  | answer.sentiment | answer.themes | generated_tokens.themes_generated_tokens | answer.improvements |

We can do a quick tally of the sentiments:

```python
results.select("sentiment").tally()
```

|  | answer.sentiment | count |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0 | Positive | 4 |
| 1 | Neutral | 4 |
| 2 | Negative | 2 |

We can also transform the results into a dataframe:

```python
df = results.to_pandas()
df.head()
```

5 rows × 69 columns

We can also use pandas methods by first converting:

```python
df_sentiment = results.to_pandas()["answer.sentiment"]
df_sentiment.value_counts()
```

```python
answer.sentiment
Positive    4
Neutral     4
Negative    2

```

## Use responses to construct new questions

We can use the responses to our initial questions to construct more questions about the texts. For example, we can prompt a model to condense the individual lists of themes and areas for improvement into short lists, and then use the new lists to quantify the topics across the set of evaluations.

Here we take the lists of themes in each evaluation, flatten them into a (duplicative) list, and then create a new question prompting a model to condense it for us:

```python
results.select("themes", "themes_generated_tokens")
```

|  | answer.themes | generated_tokens.themes_generated_tokens |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0 | ['Engaging and informative course content', 'Effective explanation of complex concepts', 'Fast pace and challenging readings'] | ["Engaging and informative course content", "Effective explanation of complex concepts", "Fast pace and challenging readings"] The summary focuses on the student's main points: positive feedback on engagement and clarity, and constructive criticism regarding the pace. This is concise and addresses both strengths and weaknesses. |
| 1 | ['Student found the material dry and difficult', 'Lack of real-world connection and examples cited', 'Desire for more current event examples to increase engagement'] | ["Student found the material dry and difficult", "Lack of real-world connection and examples cited", "Desire for more current event examples to increase engagement"] The student's feedback clearly highlights three key areas: difficulty with the material's dryness, a need for better real-world application, and a specific suggestion for using current events to improve engagement. These points are concise and address the core concerns expressed. |
| 2 | ['Enthusiastic and helpful professor', 'Engaging and interactive lectures', 'Practical and digestible assignments'] | ["Enthusiastic and helpful professor", "Engaging and interactive lectures", "Practical and digestible assignments"] The student highlighted three key strengths: the professor's positive attitude and availability, the lecture style, and the nature of the assignments. These are the most concise and impactful points for summarizing the feedback. |
| 3 | ['Appreciated analytical rigor', 'Desired more real-world application discussions', 'Felt disconnect between theory and practice'] | ["Appreciated analytical rigor", "Desired more real-world application discussions", "Felt disconnect between theory and practice"] The student's evaluation highlights both positive and negative aspects. The first point captures the student's appreciation for the mathematical strength of the course. The second and third points address the student's main concern: a perceived lack of connection between the theoretical concepts and their practical relevance. These three points concisely summarize the core message of the evaluation. |
| 4 | ['Positive experience with group projects and real-world application', 'Desire for more detailed assignment feedback', 'Overall enjoyment of the course'] | ["Positive experience with group projects and real-world application", "Desire for more detailed assignment feedback", "Overall enjoyment of the course"] The student enjoyed the course and its practical application but wants more thorough feedback on assignments. These three points capture the essence of the evaluation concisely. |
| 5 | ['Well-organized course content', 'Monotonous and hard-to-follow lectures', 'Suggestions for visual aids and guest lecturers'] | ["Well-organized course content", "Monotonous and hard-to-follow lectures", "Suggestions for visual aids and guest lecturers"] The three points accurately reflect the student's main criticisms and suggestions, concisely summarizing the evaluation. |
| 6 | ['Enjoyed the balance of theory and case studies', 'Exams perceived as fair', 'Appreciated diverse perspectives on global economic policies'] | ["Enjoyed the balance of theory and case studies", "Exams perceived as fair", "Appreciated diverse perspectives on global economic policies"] The student highlights three distinct aspects of the course: the pedagogical approach (theory and case studies), assessment (fair exams), and content (global policy diversity). These are concise and represent the core positive feedback. |
| 7 | ['Textbook complexity', 'Uneven lecture-textbook integration', 'Suggestion for simpler materials or enhanced lectures'] | ["Textbook complexity", "Uneven lecture-textbook integration", "Suggestion for simpler materials or enhanced lectures"] The student clearly identifies textbook complexity and jargon as major obstacles, highlighting a disconnect between lectures and the textbook's content. The suggestion for improvement directly addresses these issues. |
| 8 | ["Professor's strong subject knowledge and passion were evident", 'Over-reliance on testing as assessment method', 'Need for diverse assignment types to cater to varied learning styles'] | ["Professor's strong subject knowledge and passion were evident", "Over-reliance on testing as assessment method", "Need for diverse assignment types to cater to varied learning styles"] The summary accurately reflects the student's main points without unnecessary detail, focusing on the core strengths and weaknesses highlighted in the evaluation. |

```python
themes = results.select("themes").to_list(flatten = True)
```

Next we construct a question to condense the list into a new list:

```python
from edsl import Scenario

scenario = Scenario({"themes":themes})
```

```python
q_condensed_themes = QuestionList(
    question_name="condensed_themes",
    question_text="""Combine the following list of themes extracted from the evaluations
    into a consolidated, non-redundant list: {{ scenario.themes }}""",
    max_list_items=10,
)
```

Now we run the question and select the new list. Note that we can choose whether we want to use the agent for this question by not adding it to the question when we run it:

```python
condensed_themes = q_condensed_themes.by(scenario).run().select("condensed_themes").to_list()[0]
condensed_themes
```

```python
['Engaging and informative course content',
 'Effective explanation of complex concepts',
 'Desire for more real-world applications and examples',
 'Enthusiastic and knowledgeable professor',
 'Well-organized and interactive lectures',
 'Practical and digestible assignments',
 'Need for diverse assessment methods',
 'Appreciated analytical rigor and diverse perspectives',
 'Suggestions for improved lecture materials',
 'Positive experience with group projects and case studies']
```

Now we can create a question to identify all the themes in the list that appear in each evaluation (our new list becomes the list of answer options):

```python
from edsl import QuestionCheckBox

q_themes_list = QuestionCheckBox(
    question_name="themes_list",
    question_text="Select all of the themes that are mentioned in this evaluation: {{ scenario.evaluation }}",
    question_options=condensed_themes,
)
```

Here we run the question and show a table listing all the themes for each evaluation in the results:

```python
themes_lists = q_themes_list.by(scenarios).by(agent).run()
themes_lists.select("evaluation", "themes_list")
```

|  | scenario.evaluation | answer.themes_list |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0 | I found the course very engaging and informative. The professor did an excellent job breaking down complex concepts, making them accessible to those of us new to economics. However, the pace was a bit fast, and I sometimes struggled to keep up with the weekly readings. | ['Engaging and informative course content', 'Effective explanation of complex concepts'] |
| 1 | This class was a struggle for me. The material felt dry and difficult to connect with real-world applications, which I think could have made it more interesting.
