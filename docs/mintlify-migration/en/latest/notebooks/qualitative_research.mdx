title: "Launch an interview"
description: "This notebook provides sample [EDSL](/en/latest/index) code for simulating qualitative research interviews. In a series of steps we construct an AI agent representing a qualitative researcher and launch an interview with specified topics and interview subjects."
---

Please also see examples of the `Conversation` [module](https://github.com/expectedparrot/edsl/tree/main/edsl/conversation) which automates the methods used below to simulate a conversation with multiple agents:

- [Buying a car](https://github.com/expectedparrot/edsl/blob/main/edsl/conversation/car_buying.py)
- [Negotiating a mug](https://github.com/expectedparrot/edsl/blob/main/edsl/conversation/mug_negotiation.py)

[EDSL is an open-source library](https://github.com/expectedparrot/edsl) for simulating surveys, experiments and other research with AI agents and large language models. Before running the code below, please ensure that you have [installed the EDSL library](/en/latest/installation) and either [activated remote inference](/en/latest/remote_inference) from your [Coop account](/en/latest/coop) or [stored API keys](/en/latest/api_keys) for the language models that you want to use with EDSL. Please also see our [documentation page](/en/latest/index) for tips and tutorials on getting started using EDSL.

```python
from edsl import QuestionFreeText, Agent, Scenario, Model

import textwrap
from rich import print
```

EDSL works with many popular language models ([learn more](/en/latest/language_models) about using models). Here we select one to use in running in our survey:

```python
model = Model("gpt-4o")
```

Here we create methods for constructing agents representing a researcher and subject, and conducting an interview in the form of a survey that we can observe. (Learn more about [designing agents](/en/latest/agents) and [running surveys](/en/latest/surveys)).

```python expandable
def construct_subject(name, traits={}):
    return Agent(name=name, traits=traits)

def construct_researcher(product, topics):
    background = textwrap.dedent(
        f"""
    You are an expert qualitative researcher. You are researching this product: {product}.
    You are interested in conducting interviews to learn people's views on the following topics relating
    to the product: {topics}."""
    )

    instruction = textwrap.dedent(
        """
    You know to ask questions that are appropriate to the age and experience of an interview subject.
    You know to not ask questions that an interview subject would not be able to answer,
    e.g., if they are a young child, they probably will not be able to answer many questions about prices.
    You ask excellent follow-up questions.
    """

    return Agent(traits={"background": background}, instruction=instruction)

rewind them with a pencil sometimes. It sounds kind of funny!"

would ever want to try listening to music on one? What do you think the experience might be like compared to using
your phone or Spotify?",
    'response': "I think it would be pretty cool to try listening to music on a cassette tape at least once! It
seems like it would be a totally different experience from using my phone or Spotify. With a cassette, you can't
just skip to the next song with a tap, so you'd have to listen to the whole album or mix, which might be fun
because you could discover new favorite songs that way. Plus, the idea of using a pencil to rewind the tape sounds
kind of like a fun little challenge. It might feel more special and hands-on compared to just tapping a screen. I
bet the sound might be different too, maybe a bit more old-school or warm, which could be interesting to hear!"

    'question': 'You mentioned that using a pencil to rewind the tape sounds like a fun challenge. Do you think
having more hands-on interactions with music, like with cassette tapes, could change the way you enjoy music or
make it feel more special?',
    'response': "Yeah, I think having more hands-on interactions with music could definitely make it feel more
special! When you have to do something like rewind a tape with a pencil, it makes you pay more attention to what
you're listening to. It's not just about pressing play and letting it go in the background. Plus, it might make you
appreciate the music more because you have to work a little to hear it. It sounds like it would be more of an
experience, kind of like going to a concert where you really focus on the music and enjoy every part of it. I think
it could make listening to music feel more personal and memorable!"

{
    'question': "Since you're interested in the hands-on aspect of cassette tapes and how it might make music feel
more personal, I'm curious: Do you think having a physical collection of music, like a bunch of cassette tapes,
would be exciting for you? How would owning physical copies of your favorite albums or songs change the way you
think about or connect with your music?",
    'response': 'I think having a physical collection of music, like a bunch of cassette tapes, would be super
exciting! It would be like having a little treasure chest of all my favorite songs and albums. I think owning
physical copies would make me feel more connected to the music because I could actually hold it in my hands and see
the album art up close. Plus, it would be fun to organize them and maybe even show them off to my friends. Having a
collection would probably make me appreciate my favorite songs even more because it would be something I chose to
keep and take care of. It might feel like I have my own little music library, and each tape could have its own
story or memory attached to it. I think it would make listening to music feel more special and meaningful!'

    'question': "You've shared some great thoughts on how cassette tapes could make music more personal and
meaningful. I'm curious, have you ever created your own playlists or mixtapes on your phone or Spotify? If so, how
do you think that experience compares to what it might be like to make a mixtape on a cassette?",
    'response': "Yeah, I've definitely made my own playlists on my phone and Spotify! It's really fun to pick out
all my favorite songs and put them together, especially when I can choose a theme or mood for the playlist. I like
that I can add or remove songs anytime and share them with my friends really easily.nnI think making a mixtape on
a cassette would be a lot different, though. It seems like it would take more time and planning because you'd have
to record each song in order and make sure everything fits just right. You can't just drag and drop like on a
phone! I think it would feel more like a creative project, almost like making a custom gift for someone. Plus,
since cassettes are physical, it would be cool to decorate the tape or case with drawings or stickers to make it
even more personal. It sounds like it would be a really fun and special way to share music with someone!"
