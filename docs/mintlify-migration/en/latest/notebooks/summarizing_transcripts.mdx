title: "Analyzing customer service calls"
description: "This notebook provides sample [EDSL](/en/latest/index) code for conducting an analysis of textual content with AI agents and large language models. Using a set of transcripts of mock customer calls as an example, we use EDSL to prompt an AI agent to identify the callersâ€™ names, emails, questions and requests and return the results as a formatted dataset. The code is readily editable for reviewing other content, giving the agent different personas, and prompting the agent to extract other information."
---

## Technical setup

Before running the code below, please ensure that you have [installed the EDSL library](/en/latest/installation) and either [activated remote inference](/en/latest/remote_inference) from your [Coop account](/en/latest/coop) or [stored API keys](/en/latest/api_keys) for the language models that you want to use with EDSL. Please also see our [documentation page](/en/latest/index) for tips and tutorials on getting started using EDSL.

## Constructing questions about the data

We start by constructing questions about the content we want to analyze. [EDSL comes with a variety of question types](/en/latest/questions) that we can choose from based on the form of the response that we want to get back from the model (multiple choice, linear scale, free text, etc.). Here we use `QuestionFreeText` to get the caller names and emails and `QuestionList` to list out any questions and requests of the callers, with a `{{ placeholder }}` for a transcript:

```python expandable
from edsl import QuestionFreeText, QuestionList

# Construct questions in the relevant question type templates
# Use a placeholder for the transcripts to be reviewed
q_name = QuestionFreeText(
    question_name="name",
    question_text="""
    What is caller's name? Transcript: {{ scenario.transcript }}
    Return just the name of the caller.
    """,
)

q_email = QuestionFreeText(
    question_name="email",
    question_text="""What is caller's email address? Transcript: {{ scenario.transcript }}
    Return just the email address.
    """,
)

q_questions = QuestionList(
    question_name="questions",
    question_text="What questions does the caller have? Transcript: {{ scenario.transcript }}?",
)

q_requests = QuestionList(
    question_name="requests",
    question_text="What is the caller requesting? Transcript: {{ scenario.transcript }}?",
)
```

## Creating a survey

We combine the questions into a `Survey` in order to administer them all together:

```python
from edsl import Survey

survey = Survey([q_name, q_email, q_questions, q_requests])
```

## Adding context to questions

Next we import a dataset of transcripts to add to the questions, creating a `Scenario` dictionary for each transcript. [EDSL provides methods for importing content from many different data sources](/en/latest/scenarios), including PDFs, CSVs, docs, images, tables, lists, dicts, etc. Here we use a CSV of texts, [retrieved from the Coop](https://www.expectedparrot.com/content/01474c60-d02b-4874-a577-953e870d8bff):

```python
from edsl import FileStore

csv_file = FileStore.pull('01474c60-d02b-4874-a577-953e870d8bff')
```

```python
from edsl import ScenarioList, Scenario

scenarios = ScenarioList.from_source("csv", csv_file.to_tempfile())

defaultdict(<function DelimitedFileSource.to_scenario_list.<locals>.<lambda> at 0x1234242c0>, {})
```

We can inspect the scenarios ([and rename or edit them as desired](/en/latest/scenarios)):

```python
scenarios
```
```
ScenarioList scenarios: 10; keys: ['transcript'];
```

## Designing an AI agent to answer the survey

We can create a persona for an AI `Agent` that a language model will use to answer the questions, and give it instructions on the task:

```python
from edsl import Agent

agent = Agent(
    traits={"persona": "Customer service agent"},
    instruction="You are answering questions about transcripts of customer service calls.",
)
```

[Learn more](/en/latest/agents) about designing AI agents.

## Selecting a language model

We can select one or more specific models to generate the responses (if no model is specified the default model is used).

Information about models is [available here](https://www.expectedparrot.com/models). To check a list of service providers:

```python
from edsl import Model

Model.services()
```

|  | Service Name |
| :--- | :--- |
| 0 | anthropic |
| 1 | azure |
| 2 | bedrock |
| 3 | deep_infra |
| 4 | deepseek |
| 5 | google |
| 6 | groq |
| 7 | mistral |
| 8 | ollama |
| 9 | openai |
| 10 | openai_v2 |
| 11 | perplexity |
| 12 | together |
| 13 | xai |

To check the current default model:

```python
Model()
```
```
LanguageModel
```

|  | key | value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0 | model | gpt-4o |
| 1 | parameters:temperature | 0.500000 |
| 2 | parameters:max_tokens | 1000 |
| 3 | parameters:top_p | 1 |
| 4 | parameters:frequency_penalty | 0 |
| 5 | parameters:presence_penalty | 0 |
| 6 | parameters:logprobs | False |
| 7 | parameters:top_logprobs | 3 |
| 8 | inference_service | openai |

Here we select a model:

```python
model = Model("gpt-4o", servive_name = "google")
```

[Learn more](/en/latest/language_models) about specifying language models.

## Getting responses

We generate responses by adding the scenarios, agent and model to the survey and then calling the `run()` method:

```python
results = survey.by(scenarios).by(agent).by(model).run()
```

This generates a dataset of `Results` that we can begin analyzing. EDSL comes with [built-in methods for analyzing results](/en/latest/results). For example, we can print the responses in a table:

```python
results.select("name", "email", "questions", "requests")
```

|  | answer.name | answer.email | answer.questions | answer.requests |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

## Quantifying responses

We can use the lists of caller questions and requests to quantify them (how often do they appear in the calls?). We start by prompting an agent to synthesize the lists into comprehensive lists that we can use as question options for new questions:

```python
caller_questions = results.select("questions").to_list(flatten=True)
len(caller_questions)
```
```python
19
```
```python
caller_requests = results.select("requests").to_list(flatten=True)
len(caller_requests)
```

```python
22
```

```python
q_condense = QuestionList(
    question_name="condense",
    question_text="""
    You have reviewed a set of call transcripts and compiled a detailed list of {{ scenario.topic }}.
    Now you are being asked to condense this list into a more generalized but comprehensive
    list that can be used to quanitfy the {{ scenario.topic }} efficiently (i.e., combine like items
    on the list). Here is the list to be condensed: {{ scenario.list }}
    """,
    max_list_items=10,  # Optional
)

scenarios = ScenarioList([
    Scenario({"topic": "caller questions", "list": caller_questions}),
    Scenario({"topic": "caller requests", "list": caller_requests}),
])

condensed_lists = q_condense.by(scenarios).run()
```

```python
condensed_lists.select("topic", "condense")
```

|  | scenario.topic | answer.condense |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0 | caller questions | ['Technical issues with software features', 'Version and update inquiries', 'Account access and password issues', 'Guides and instructional resources', 'Project collaboration and team management', 'Exporting and file management issues', 'Cost estimation and project calculations', 'Data access and retrieval issues', 'Feedback and feature requests', 'Trial period questions'] |
| 1 | caller requests | ['Technical support and troubleshooting', 'Account access and security', 'Subscription and billing inquiries', 'Feature usage tutorials and guides', 'Project collaboration and management', 'Software updates and version issues', 'Exporting and file handling', 'Automated tools and estimation', 'Trial period information', 'Remote support and follow-up'] |

We can use the condensed lists as options for new questions quantifying the topics:

```python
condensed_questions = (
    condensed_lists.filter("topic == 'caller questions'").select("condense").first()
)
condensed_questions
```

```python
['Technical issues with software features',
 'Version and update inquiries',
 'Account access and password issues',
 'Guides and instructional resources',
 'Project collaboration and team management',
 'Exporting and file management issues',
 'Cost estimation and project calculations',
 'Data access and retrieval issues',
 'Feedback and feature requests',
 'Trial period questions']
```

```python
condensed_requests = (
    condensed_lists.filter("topic == 'caller requests'").select("condense").first()
)
condensed_requests
```

```python
['Technical support and troubleshooting',
 'Account access and security',
 'Subscription and billing inquiries',
 'Feature usage tutorials and guides',
 'Project collaboration and management',
 'Software updates and version issues',
 'Exporting and file handling',
 'Automated tools and estimation',
 'Trial period information',
 'Remote support and follow-up']
```

```python expandable
from edsl import QuestionCheckBox

q_questions_agg = QuestionCheckBox(
    question_name="questions_agg",
    question_text="""
    Review the following call transcript and then identify the topic(s)
    that the caller has questions about. Transcript: {{ scenario.transcript }}
    """,
    question_options=condensed_questions + ["Something else", "None of these"],
)

q_requests_agg = QuestionCheckBox(
    question_name="requests_agg",
    question_text="""
    Review the following call transcript and then identify the topic(s)
    that the caller has requests about. Transcript: {{ scenario.transcript }}
    """,
    question_options=condensed_requests + ["Something else", "None of these"],
)

survey = Survey([q_questions_agg, q_requests_agg])
```

We can use the results of the initial survey as scenarios of our follow-on questions. The `to_scenario_list()` method lets us do this in a single step:

```python
scenarios = results.select("name", "email", "transcript").to_scenario_list(
    remove_prefix=True
)
scenarios[0]
```

## Visualizations

We can turn the results into a dataframe and inspect the totals:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import ast
```

```python
df = agg_results.to_pandas(remove_prefix=True)
```

```python
# Convert the string representations of lists to actual lists
df["questions_agg"] = df["questions_agg"].apply(ast.literal_eval)
df["requests_agg"] = df["requests_agg"].apply(ast.literal_eval)

# Explode the lists into individual rows
questions_exploded = df.explode("questions_agg")
requests_exploded = df.explode("requests_agg")

# Count the frequency of each item
questions_counts = questions_exploded["questions_agg"].value_counts().reset_index()
questions_counts.columns = ["Question", "Count"]

requests_counts = requests_exploded["requests_agg"].value_counts().reset_index()
requests_counts.columns = ["Request", "Count"]
```

```python
# Plotting
