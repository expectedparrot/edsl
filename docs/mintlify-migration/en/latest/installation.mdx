**Note**

EDSL is in development. We recommend that you continually check for and install the latest version of EDSL to access the most recent features and bug fixes.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

Please ensure that Python is installed on your system before you install EDSL. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

You can use [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) to install EDSL on your system (a package installer for Python).

## Quickstart Installation

Open your terminal and verify that you have not previously installed EDSL by running the following command:

```bash
pip show edsl
```

If EDSL is already installed, you will see the following output, including the actual version number:

```bash
Name: edsl
Version: 1.0.###
...
```

If EDSL is not installed (WARNING: Package(s) not found: edsl), you can run either of the following commands to install the latest version using pip:

```bash
pip install edsl
```

Or:

```bash
! uv pip install edsl -q
```

Then get your API key from Expected Parrot and import dependencies:

```python
from edsl import login

login()
```

This will prompt you to log into your Expected Parrot account and automatically retrieve your API key. See the [Managing Keys](/en/latest/api_keys) section for more details on managing your API keys for language models.

## Installing from source

If you want to install EDSL from source, you can clone the repository from GitHub:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/expectedparrot/edsl.git@main
```

This allows you to pull the latest changes from the repository (which may not be in the latest version available at PyPI) and install them on your system.

## Updating your version

To confirm that your version is up to date, compare your version number with the latest version on the [EDSL PyPI page](https://pypi.org/project/edsl/).

To update your EDSL version to the latest one:

```bash
pip install --upgrade edsl
```

## Advanced installation

The steps above will install EDSL globally on your system. Sometimes, you may face problems with conflicts between EDSL and other libraries. To avoid such problems, we recommend that you use a virtual environment.

To create a virtual environment, open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
python -m venv myenv
```

This will create a folder called myenv. Next, activate your virtual environment:

```bash
source myenv/bin/activate
```

You can now install EDSL through pip within your virtual environment:

```bash
pip install edsl
```

Or:

```bash
! uv pip install edsl -q
```

You will have access to EDSL while your virtual environment is activated.

You can deactivate the virtual environment at any time by running:

```bash
deactivate
```

To delete the virtual environment, simply delete the myenv folder.
