Your Expected Parrot platform account provides access to special features for running EDSL surveys and storing results remotely at the Expected Parrot server, and launching hybrid human-AI inference jobs interactively. Learn more about these features in the [Remote Inference](/en/latest/remote_inference), [Remote Caching](/en/latest/remote_caching) and [Survey Builder](/en/latest/survey_builder) sections of the documentation.

## Getting started

### 1. Create an account

[Sign up](https://www.expectedparrot.com/login) with an email address.

Your account comes with an **Expected Parrot API key** that allows you to:

- Post and share content on the Expected Parrot platform
- Run surveys at the Expected Parrot server
- Use any available models with your surveys
- Use the universal cache of stored prompts and responses

You can inspect your key and reset it at any time at your [Keys](https://www.expectedparrot.com/home/keys) page.

### 2. Your Expected Parrot API key

Remote inference is a feature that allows you to run EDSL surveys and inference jobs at the Expected Parrot server, and store results at your account. It is activated by default when you create an account. When remote inference is activated, your survey jobs and results are automatically stored at the Expected Parrot server and accessible at the [Results](https://www.expectedparrot.com/home/remote-inference) page of your account.

You can also post any EDSL objects to the Expected Parrot platform from your workspace, includes Results, Surveys, Agents, Scenarios, Notebooks and data files (using the FileStore module). To do this, you first need to store your Expected Parrot API key. If you have activated remote inference (at your [Settings](https://www.expectedparrot.com/home/settings) page), your key is automatically stored.

If you are only using EDSL locally, create a file named .env in your EDSL working directory and store your key in it using the following format:

```bash
EXPECTED_PARROT_API_KEY = 'your_key_here'
```

Learn more about storing API keys in the [Managing Keys](/en/latest/api_keys) section of the documentation.

### 3. Post objects to the Expected Parrot platform

Use the Coop module and methods to post and share objects (see examples below). You can set the visibility status of an object when you post it or update it later, from your workspace or interactively at your account. There are 3 status options:

- *public*: Visible to everyone
- *private*: Visible to logged in users that you have granted access
- *unlisted*: Visible to anyone with the link but not listed in search results (default)

See details on methods for uploading, downloading, updating and deleting content on the Expected Parrot platform below.

### 4. Explore content

Content that you have created with remote inference or posted to the Expected Parrot platform is available at your [Content](https://www.expectedparrot.com/content) page:

<Frame>
<img src="/images/en/latest/coop_2.png" alt="Expected Parrot platform page view" />
</Frame>

You can access public content at the [Explore](https://www.expectedparrot.com/content/explore) tab, and copy code and examples to modify or rerun at your workspace.

## Methods

When remote inference is activated the results of your surveys are automatically added to your [Content](https://www.expectedparrot.com/content) page. You can modify them from your workspace or interactively at your account.

You can also post, update, download and delete any objects at Coop using the Coop module and methods (see examples below).

### Posting

There are 2 methods for uploading/posting an object from your workspace to the Expected Parrot platform:

1. Call the *push()* method on the object directly.
2. Call the *create()* method on a *Coop* client object and pass it the object.

You can optionally pass a description, a convenient alias for the Expected Parrot platform URL and a *visibility* status (public, private or unlisted (default)) when you create an object. These can be changed at any time.

**Direct method**

Here we post a question object by calling the *push()* method on it:

```python
from edsl import QuestionFreeText

q = QuestionFreeText(
  question_name = "example",
  question_text = "How are you today?"
)

q.push(
  description="This is an example question", # optional
  alias = "my-example-question", # optional
  visibility="public" # optional
)
```

We can see the description, alias and visibility status that we specified in the information that is returned:

```json
{'description': 'This is an example question',
'object_type': 'question',
'url': 'https://www.expectedparrot.com/content/1706e6f9-2675-4433-8b0a-080654a5cd08',
'alias_url': 'https://www.expectedparrot.com/content/RobinHorton/my-example-question',
'uuid': '1706e6f9-2675-4433-8b0a-080654a5cd08',
'version': '0.1.47.dev1',
'visibility': 'public'}
```

**Using a Coop client**

Here we post the same question by passing it to the *create()* method of a *Coop* client object:

```python
from edsl import Coop, QuestionFreeText

q = QuestionFreeText(
  question_name = "example",
  question_text = "How are you today?"
)
c = Coop()
c.create(q)
```

Here we include a description and visibility status:

```python
from edsl import Coop, QuestionFreeText

q = QuestionFreeText(
  question_name = "example",
  question_text = "How are you today?"
)
c = Coop()
c.create(object=q, description="This is an example question", alias = "another-example-question", visibility="public")
```

This will return the same information about the object as the direct method shown above (with a unique uuid and URL for viewing the object on the Expected Parrot platform web app).

### Updating

There are 3 methods for updating/editing an object on the Expected Parrot platform:

1. Edit the object on the Expected Parrot platform web app.
2. Call the *patch()* method on the object directly.
3. Call the *patch()* method on a *Coop* client object.

For each patch() method, pass the alias_url or the uuid of the object and the parameter(s) that you want to update: *description*, *visibility*, *alias* and/or *value*.

- The *description* parameter is used to update the description of an object, such as a question or survey.
- The *visibility* parameter is used to update the visibility of an object: *public*, *private* or *unlisted*.
- The *value* parameter is used to update the content of an object, such as the text of a question or the code in a notebook.

**On the Expected Parrot platform web app**

You can manually update the description or visibility of an object on the Expected Parrot platform web app. Navigate to the [Explore](https://www.expectedparrot.com/content/explore) page and open the page view for an object. You can select options to change the **visibility** of the object (*public*, *private* or *unlisted*) or to **edit** the description.

**Direct method**

Here we update the description and *visibility* of the question we created and uploaded in the examples above by calling the patch() method on it:

```python
q.patch("https://www.expectedparrot.com/content/RobinHorton/my-example-question",
        description="This is an updated question",
        visibility="unlisted")
```

This will return a status message:

```json
{'status': 'success'}
```

Here we change the question itself by modifying the value parameter:

```python
from edsl import QuestionMultipleChoice

new_q = QuestionMultipleChoice(
  question_name = "example",
  question_text = "How are you today?",
  question_options = ["Good", "Bad", "OK"]
)
q.patch("https://www.expectedparrot.com/content/RobinHorton/my-example-question",
        value=new_q)
```

**Using a Coop client**

Here we do the same using a Coop client object:

```python
from edsl import Coop

c = Coop()
c.patch("https://www.expectedparrot.com/content/1706e6f9-2675-4433-8b0a-080654a5cd08",
        description="This is an updated question",
        visibility="public")
```

This will return the same status message as above.

### Replicating / Downloading

There are a variety of methods for replicating or downloading an object on the Expected Parrot platform:

1. Selecting options to download or copy code on the Expected Parrot platform web app
2. Calling the *pull()* method on the class of the object
3. Calling the *get()* method on a *Coop* client object

**Copy code on the Expected Parrot platform web app**

The Expected Parrot platform web app provides copyable code for downloading or reconstructing an object that has been posted:

<Steps>
  <Step>
  Navigate to the [Explore](https://www.expectedparrot.com/content/explore) page and select an object
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Go to the object’s page
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Select the option to **Download** the object
  </Step>
</Steps>

OR

- Select the option to **Pull** the object using its uuid or **Raw** to get the code for constructing the object:

<Frame>
<img src="/images/en/latest/coop_3.png" alt="Expected Parrot platform page view" />
</Frame>
<br/>
<Frame>
<img src="/images/en/latest/coop_4.png" alt="Expected Parrot platform page view" />
</Frame>


Use this code in your workspace to download the object locally or to reconstruct it.

**Class method**

Here we download the question posted above by calling the pull() method on the object class (Question) and passing the uuid of the object:

```python
from edsl import Question

q = Question.pull("1706e6f9-2675-4433-8b0a-080654a5cd08")
q
```

This will return the object (the multiple choice question question that replaced the free text question):

| key | value |
| :--- | :--- |
| question_name | example |
| question_text | How are you today? |
| question_options:0 | Good |
| question_options:1 | Bad |
| question_options:2 | OK |
| question_type | multiple_choice |

**Using a Coop client**

Here we download the question by calling the get() method on a Coop client object:

```python
from edsl import Coop

c = Coop()
q = c.get("1706e6f9-2675-4433-8b0a-080654a5cd08")
q
```

This will return the same object as above.

### Deleting

There are 3 methods for deleting an object from the Expected Parrot platform:

1. Selecting options to delete on the Expected Parrot platform web app
2. Calling the *delete()* method on the class of the object
3. Calling the *delete()* method on a *Coop* client object

**On the Expected Parrot platform web app**

You can manually delete objects on the Expected Parrot platform web app:

<Steps>
  <Step>
  Navigate to [Explore](https://www.expectedparrot.com/content/explore) and open an object’s page view (see image above for *Uploading* content)
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Select the option to **delete** the object:

<Frame>
<img src="/images/en/latest/coop_5.png" alt="Expected Parrot platform page view" />
</Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Directly**

Here we delete a question object by calling the *delete()* method on the class of the object (*Question*) and passing the uuid of the object:

```python
from edsl import Question

Question.delete("1234abcd-abcd-1234-abcd-1234abcd1234") # mock uuid
```

This will return a status message:

```json
{'status': 'success'}
```

**Using a Coop client**

Here we delete a question by calling the *delete()* method on a *Coop* client object, passing the uuid of the object:

```python
from edsl import Coop

c = Coop()
c.delete(uuid="1234abcd-abcd-1234-abcd-1234abcd1234") # mock uuid
```

This will return the same status message as above (so long as the object was not already deleted).

### Projects

You can create a project on the Expected Parrot platform web app by selecting the option to **Create a project** at the top right of the page.

You can also create a project by calling the *create_project()* method on a *Coop* client object:

```python
from edsl import Coop

c = Coop()
c.create_project(
  project_name = "My project",
  description = "This is a project",
  visibility = "public"
)
```

### Special methods

There are several special methods for working with Coop objects:

## Feature requests

If you have a feature request for the Coop, please let us know! There are several ways to do this:

- Create an issue at [GitHub](/en/latest/contributing)
- Post a message at [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/mxAYkjfy9m)
- Send us an email: [info@expectedparrot.com](mailto:info@expectedparrot.com)

The coop module provides connectivity with Expected Parrot’s cloud services.

This module enables EDSL to interact with cloud-based resources for enhanced functionality: 1. Remote storage and sharing of EDSL objects (surveys, agents, models, results, etc.) 2. Remote inference execution for running jobs in the cloud 3. Caching of interview results for improved performance and cost savings 4. API key management and authentication 5. Price and model availability information 6. Plugin registry and discovery

The primary interface is the Coop class, which serves as a client for the Expected Parrot API. Most users will only need to interact with the Coop class directly.

Examples:

```python
python from edsl.coop import Coop coop = Coop() # Uses API key from environment or stored location survey = my_survey.push() # Uploads survey to Expected Parrot job_info = coop.remote_inference_create(my_job) # Creates remote job

# Working with plugins from edsl.coop import get_available_plugins plugins = get_available_plugins() plugin_names = [p.name for p in plugins]
```

> ### *class* edsl.coop.Coop(*api_key: str | None = None*, *url: str | None = None*)[[source]](https://github.com/expectedparrot/edsl/blob/main/edsl/coop.py)

Bases: `CoopFunctionsMixin`

Client for the Expected Parrot API that provides cloud-based functionality for EDSL.

The Coop class is the main interface for interacting with Expected Parrot’s cloud services. It enables:

1. Storing and retrieving EDSL objects (surveys, agents, models, results, etc.)
2. Running inference jobs remotely for better performance and scalability
3. Retrieving and caching interview results
4. Managing API keys and authentication
5. Accessing model availability and pricing information

The client handles authentication, serialization/deserialization of EDSL objects, and communication with the Expected Parrot API endpoints. It also provides methods for tracking job status and managing results.

When initialized without parameters, Coop will attempt to use an API key from: 1. The EXPECTED_PARROT_API_KEY environment variable 2. A stored key in the user’s config directory 3. Interactive login if needed

**Attributes:**

api_key (str): The API key used for authentication url (str): The base URL for the Expected Parrot API api_url (str): The URL for API endpoints (derived from base URL)

> #### __init__(*api_key: str | None = None*, *url: str | None = None*) → None[[source]](https://github.com/expectedparrot/edsl/blob/main/edsl/coop.py)

Initialize the Expected Parrot API client.

This constructor sets up the connection to Expected Parrot’s cloud services. If not provided explicitly, it will attempt to obtain an API key from environment variables or from a stored location in the user’s config directory.

>**Parameters:**

**api_key (str, optional): API key for authentication with Expected Parrot.**

If not provided, will attempt to obtain from environment or stored location.

**url (str, optional): Base URL for the Expected Parrot service.**

If not provided, uses the default from configuration.

>**Notes:**

- The API key is stored in the EXPECTED_PARROT_API_KEY environment variable or in a platform-specific config directory
- The URL is determined based on whether it’s a production, staging, or development environment
- The api_url for actual API endpoints is derived from the base URL

>**Example:**

```python
>>> coop = Coop()  # Uses API key from environment or stored location
>>> coop = Coop(api_key="your-api-key")  # Explicitly provide API key
```

> #### fetch_models() → Dict[str, List[str]][[source]](https://github.com/expectedparrot/edsl/blob/main/edsl/coop.py)

Fetch information about available language models from Expected Parrot.

This method retrieves the current list of available language models grouped by service provider (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.). This information is useful for programmatically selecting models based on availability and for ensuring that jobs only use supported models.

**Returns:**

ServiceToModelsMapping: A mapping of service providers to their available models.

**Example structure:**

```json
{
“openai”: [“gpt-4”, “gpt-3.5-turbo”, …], “anthropic”: [“claude-3-opus”, “claude-3-sonnet”, …], …
}

**Raises:**

CoopServerResponseError: If there’s an error communicating with the server

**Notes:**

- The availability of models may change over time
- Not all models may be accessible with your current API keys
- Use this method to check for model availability before creating jobs
- Models may have different capabilities (text-only, multimodal, etc.)

**Example:**

```python
>>> models = coop.fetch_models()
>>> if "gpt-4" in models.get("openai", []):
...     print("GPT-4 is available")
>>> available_services = list(models.keys())
>>> print(f"Available services: {available_services}")
```

> #### fetch_prices() → dict[[source]](https://github.com/expectedparrot/edsl/blob/main/edsl/coop.py)

Fetch the current pricing information for language models.

This method retrieves the latest pricing information for all supported language models from the Expected Parrot API. The pricing data is used to estimate costs for jobs and to optimize model selection based on budget constraints.

>**Returns:**

>**dict: A dictionary mapping (service, model) tuples to pricing information.**

Each entry contains token pricing for input and output tokens.

```python
Example structure: {

  (‘openai’, ‘gpt-4’): {
  ‘input’: {‘usd_per_1M_tokens’: 30.0, …}, ‘output’: {‘usd_per_1M_tokens’: 60.0, …}

  }

}
```

> **Raises:**

ValueError: If the EDSL_FETCH_TOKEN_PRICES configuration setting is invalid

> **Notes:**

- Returns an empty dict if EDSL_FETCH_TOKEN_PRICES is set to “False”
- The pricing data is cached to minimize API calls
- Pricing may vary based on the model, provider, and token type (input/output)
- All prices are in USD per million tokens

> **Example:**

```python
>>> prices = coop.fetch_prices()
>>> gpt4_price = prices.get(('openai', 'gpt-4'), {})
>>> print(f"GPT-4 input price: ${gpt4_price.get('input', {}).get('usd_per_1M_tokens')}")
```

> #### fetch_rate_limit_config_vars() → dict[[source]](https://github.com/expectedparrot/edsl/blob/main/edsl/coop.py)

Fetch a dict of rate limit config vars from Coop.

The dict keys are RPM and TPM variables like EDSL_SERVICE_RPM_OPENAI.

> #### fetch_working_models() → List[dict][[source]](https://github.com/expectedparrot/edsl/blob/main/edsl/coop.py)

Fetch a list of working models from Coop.

Example output:

```json
[{
“service”: “openai”, “model”: “gpt-4o”, “works_with_text”: True, “works_with_images”: True, “usd_per_1M_input_tokens”: 2.5, “usd_per_1M_output_tokens”: 10.0,

> #### login_gradio(*timeout: int = 120*, *launch: bool = True*, ***launch_kwargs*)[[source]](https://github.com/expectedparrot/edsl/blob/main/edsl/coop.py)

Start the EDSL auth token login flow inside a **Gradio** application.

This helper mirrors the behaviour of [`Coop.login_streamlit()`](/en/latest "edsl.coop.Coop.login_streamlit") but renders the login link and status updates inside a Gradio UI. It will poll the Expected Parrot server for the API-key associated with a newly generated auth-token and, once received, store it via [:pyclass:`~edsl.coop.ep_key_handling.ExpectedParrotKeyHandler`](/en/latest/#id15) as well as in the local `.env` file so subsequent sessions pick it up automatically.

### Parameters

**timeoutint, default 120**

How many seconds to wait for the user to complete the login before giving up.

**launchbool, default True**

If `True` the Gradio app is immediately launched with `demo.launch(**launch_kwargs)`. Set this to `False` if you want to embed the returned `gradio.Blocks` object into an existing Gradio interface.

**[**](/en/latest/#id17)launch_kwargs**

Additional keyword-arguments forwarded to `gr.Blocks.launch` when *launch* is `True`.

### Returns

**str | gradio.Blocks | None**

- If the API-key is retrieved within *timeout* seconds while the function is executing (e.g. when *launch* is `False` and the caller integrates the Blocks into another app) the key is returned.
- If *launch* is `True` the method returns `None` after the Gradio app has been launched.
- If *launch* is `False` the constructed `gr.Blocks` is returned so the caller can compose it further.

> #### login_streamlit(*timeout: int = 120*)[[source]](https://github.com/expectedparrot/edsl/blob/main/edsl/coop.py)

Start the EDSL auth token login flow inside a Streamlit application.

This helper is functionally equivalent to `Coop.login` but renders the login link and status updates directly in the Streamlit UI. The method will automatically poll the Expected Parrot server for the API-key associated with the generated auth-token and, once received, store it via `ExpectedParrotKeyHandler` and write it to the local `.env` file so subsequent sessions pick it up automatically.

### Parameters

**timeoutint, default 120**

How many seconds to wait for the user to complete the login before giving up and showing an error in the Streamlit app.

### Returns

**str | None**

The API-key if the user logged-in successfully, otherwise `None`.

Create a remote inference job for execution in the Expected Parrot cloud.

This method sends a job to be executed in the cloud, which can be more efficient for large jobs or when you want to run jobs in the background. The job execution is handled by Expected Parrot’s infrastructure, and you can check the status and retrieve results later.

**Parameters:**

job (Jobs): The EDSL job to run in the cloud description (str, optional): A human-readable description of the job status (RemoteJobStatus): Initial status, should be “queued” for normal use

Possible values: “queued”, “running”, “completed”, “failed”

**visibility (VisibilityType): Access level for the job information. One of:**

- “private”: Only accessible by the owner
- “public”: Accessible by anyone
- “unlisted”: Accessible with the link, but not listed publicly

initial_results_visibility (VisibilityType): Access level for the job results iterations (int): Number of times to run each interview (default: 1) fresh (bool): If True, ignore existing cache entries and generate new results

> **Returns:**

**RemoteInferenceCreationInfo: Information about the created job including:**

- uuid: The unique identifier for the job
- description: The job description
- status: Current status of the job
- iterations: Number of iterations for each interview
- visibility: Access level for the job
- version: EDSL version used to create the job

> **Raises:**

CoopServerResponseError: If there’s an error communicating with the server

> **Notes:**

- Remote jobs run asynchronously and may take time to complete
- Use remote_inference_get() with the returned UUID to check status
- Credits are consumed based on the complexity of the job

> **Example:**

```python
>>> from edsl.jobs import Jobs
>>> job = Jobs.example()
>>> job_info = coop.remote_inference_create(job=job, description="My job")
>>> print(f"Job created with UUID: {job_info['uuid']}")
```

> **Raises:**

ValueError: If neither job_uuid nor results_uuid is provided CoopServerResponseError: If there’s an error communicating with the server

> **Notes:**

- Either job_uuid or results_uuid must be provided
- If both are provided, job_uuid takes precedence
- For completed jobs, you can use the results_url to view or download results
- For failed jobs, check the latest_error_report_url for debugging information

> **Example:**

```python
>>> job_status = coop.remote_inference_get("9f8484ee-b407-40e4-9652-4133a7236c9c")
>>> print(f"Job status: {job_status['status']}")
>>> if job_status['status'] == 'completed':
...     print(f"Results available at: {job_status['results_url']}")
```

Bases: `CoopErrors`

Exception raised when the server returns an error response.

This exception is raised when the Expected Parrot API returns an error response, such as authentication failures, rate limits, or server errors. The exception message typically includes the error details from the server.

To fix this error: 1. Check the exception message for specific error details from the server 2. For authentication errors (401), verify your API key is correct and not expired 3. For rate limit errors (429), reduce the frequency of your requests 4. For server errors (500+), the issue may be temporary - wait and try again 5. Check your network connection if you’re getting connection timeout errors

Example:

``python coop = Coop(api_key="invalid-key") coop.get("valid-uuid")  # Raises CoopServerResponseError with 401 Unauthorized ``

> ### *class* edsl.coop.ObjectRegistry[[source]](https://github.com/expectedparrot/edsl/blob/main/edsl/coop.py)

Bases: `object`

Registry that maps between EDSL class types and their cloud storage object types.

This utility class maintains a bidirectional mapping between EDSL Python classes (like Survey, Agent, Results) and their corresponding object type identifiers used in the cloud storage system. It enables the proper serialization, deserialization, and type checking for objects stored in Expected Parrot’s cloud services.

The registry is used by the Coop client to: 1. Determine the correct object type when uploading EDSL objects 2. Instantiate the correct class when downloading objects 3. Validate that retrieved objects match expected types

Attributes:

objects (list): List of mappings between object types and EDSL classes object_type_to_edsl_class (dict): Maps object type strings to EDSL classes edsl_class_to_object_type (dict): Maps EDSL class names to object type strings

> #### *property* edsl_class_to_object_type[[source]](https://github.com/expectedparrot/edsl/blob/main/edsl/coop.py)
