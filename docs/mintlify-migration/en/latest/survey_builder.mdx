### Create a survey

[Log in](https://www.expectedparrot.com/login) to your account and select options to create a [survey](https://www.expectedparrot.com/create/survey) and [agents](https://www.expectedparrot.com/create/agent-list). Choose whether to build a survey and agents from scratch, import data, or select and edit saved content.

### Launch a survey

Selecting the option to *Run survey* creates a new project at your account dashboard, where you can run the survey with AI agents and human respondents. You can also create a new project by selecting *Create project* at your dashboard and choosing a saved survey and agents to use with the project.

Your new project page has options for generating a shareable web version of the survey, running the survey with AI agents, and launching Prolific studies with human participants. AI and human responses will automatically appear at your dashboard where you can compare and export them.

### Analyze results

Once you have collected responses from AI agents and human respondents, you can analyze the results at your account dashboard or in EDSL code at your workspace. See the [Humanize](/en/latest/humanize#humanize) and [Prolific studies](/en/latest/prolific#prolific) sections for more details about working with human responses in EDSL code. You can also export results in CSV format for further analysis in your preferred tools.
