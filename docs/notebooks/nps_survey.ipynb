    "# NPS survey in EDSL\n",
    "This notebook provides sample [EDSL](https://github.com/expectedparrot/edsl) code for simulating a Net Promoter Score (NPS) survey with AI agents and large language models.\n",
    "In the steps below we show how to construct an EDSL survey, create personas for AI agents to answer the questions, and then administer the survey to them. \n",
    "We also demonstrate some built-in [methods for inspecting and analyzing the dataset of results](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/results.html) that is generated when an EDSL survey is run.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following questions are used in the sample survey:\n",
    "\n",
    "***On a scale from 0-10, how likely are you to recommend our company to a friend or colleague?*** <br>\n",
    "*(0=Not at all likely, 10=Very likely)* <br>\n",
    "*Please tell us why you gave a rating.*\n",
    "\n",
    "***How satisfied are you with the following experience with our company?*** <br>\n",
    "*Product quality* <br>\n",
    "*Customer support* <br>\n",
    "*Purchasing experience* <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "***Is there anything specific that our company can do to improve your experience?***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Technical setup\n",
    "Before running the code below, ensure that you have (1) [installed the EDSL library](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/installation.html) and (2) created a [Coop account](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/coop.html) to activate [remote inference](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/remote_inference.html) or stored your own [API keys for language models](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/api_keys.html) that you want to use with EDSL. Please also see our [tutorials and documentation page](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/index.html) on getting started using the EDSL library."
