    "### Constructing traits\n",
    "In comparing model responses it can be convenient to include shortnames for traits in addition to narrative personas--e.g., just the name of the agent's occupation, age, etc. Here we run a question to extract the occupation from each persona in order to store it as a separate `trait` of each agent. We use `Scenario` objects to represent the data (personas) that we add to the question when we run it. [Learn more about using scenarios](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/scenarios.html) to parameterize questions with data and context."
