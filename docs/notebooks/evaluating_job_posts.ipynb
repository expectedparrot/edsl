    "# Evaluating job posts\n",
    "This notebook provides sample code for conducting a text analysis using [EDSL](https://docs.expectedparrot.com), an open-source library for simulating surveys, experiments and other research with AI agents and large language models. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using a dataset of job posts as an example, we demonstrate how to: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import data into EDSL \n",
    "2. Create questions about the data \n",
    "3. Design an AI agent to answer the questions\n",
    "4. Select a language model to generate responses\n",
    "5. Analyze results as a formatted dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Technical setup\n",
    "Before running the code below please ensure that you have completed setup:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Install EDSL](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/installation.html).\n",
    "* Create a [Coop account](https://www.expectedparrot.com/login) and activate [remote inference](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/remote_inference.html) to run surveys at the Expected Parrot server. You can use an Expected Parrot API key or your own [API Keys](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/api_keys.html) for language models that you want to use.\n",

    "Our [Starter Tutorial](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/starter_tutorial.html) also provides examples of EDSL basic components. "
