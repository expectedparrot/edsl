    "# Analyzing customer service calls\n",
    "This notebook provides sample [EDSL](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/) code for conducting an analysis of textual content with AI agents and large language models. Using a set of transcripts of mock customer calls as an example, we use EDSL to prompt an AI agent to identify the callers' names, emails, questions and requests and return the results as a formatted dataset. The code is readily editable for reviewing other content, giving the agent different personas, and prompting the agent to extract other information.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Technical setup\n",
    "Before running the code below, please ensure that you have [installed the EDSL library](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/installation.html) and either [activated remote inference](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/remote_inference.html) from your [Coop account](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/coop.html) or [stored API keys](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/api_keys.html) for the language models that you want to use with EDSL. Please also see our [documentation page](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/) for tips and tutorials on getting started using EDSL."
