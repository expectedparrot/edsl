    "# Starter Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial provides step-by-step instructions for getting started using EDSL (*Expected Parrot Domain-Specific Language*), an open-source Python library for simulating surveys, experiments and other research tasks using AI agents and large language models.\n",
    "EDSL is developed by [Expected Parrot](https://www.expectedparrot.com/about) and available under the MIT License.\n",
    "The source code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/expectedparrot/edsl). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals of this tutorial\n",
    "We begin with technical setup: instructions for installing the EDSL library and storing API keys to access language models.\n",
    "Then we demonstrate some of the basic features of EDSL, with examples for constructing and running surveys with agents and models, analyzing responses as datasets, and validating results with human respondents.\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to use EDSL to do each of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Construct various types of [questions](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/questions.html) tailored to your research objectives.\n",
    "* Combine questions into [surveys](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/surveys.html) and integrate logical rules to control the survey flow.\n",
    "* Design personas for [AI agents](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/agents.html) to simulate responses to your surveys.\n",
    "* Choose and deploy [large language models](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/models.html) to generate responses for AI agents.\n",
    "* Analyze [results](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/results.html) as datasets with built-in analytical tools.\n",
    "* Validate LLM answers with [human respondents](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/humanize.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Storing & sharing your work\n",
    "We also introduce [Coop](https://www.expectedparrot.com/content/explore): a platform for creating, storing and sharing AI-based research and launching hybrid human/AI surveys.\n",
    "Coop is fully integrated with EDSL and free to use. \n",
    "At the end of the tutorial we show how to use EDSL with Coop by posting content created in this tutorial for anyone to view at the web app and launching a web-based survey to compare LLM and human responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Further reading & questions\n",
    "Please see our [documentation page](https://docs.expectedparrot.com) for more details on each of the topics covered in this notebook.\n",
    "If you encounter any issues or have questions, please email us at info@expectedparrot.com or post a question at our [Discord channel](https://discord.com/invite/mxAYkjfy9m).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pre-requisites\n",
    "EDSL is compatible with Python 3.9 - 3.12.\n",
    "Before starting this tutorial, please ensure that you have a Python environment set up on your machine or in a cloud-based environment, such as Google Colab.\n",
    "You can find instructions for installing Python at the [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recommendations \n",
    "The code examples in this tutorial are designed to be run in a Jupyter notebook or another Python environment, or in a cloud-based environment such as Google Colab.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using Google Colab, please see additional instructions for setting up EDSL in the [Colab setup](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/colab_setup.html) page in the documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also recommend using a virtual environment when installing and using EDSL in order to avoid conflicts with other Python packages.\n",
    "You can find instructions for setting up a virtual environment at the [Python Packaging Authority](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "To begin using EDSL, you first need to install the library. \n",
    "This can either be done locally on your machine or in a cloud-based environment, such as Google Colab.\n",
    "Once you have decided where to install EDSL, you can choose to whether install it from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/edsl/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/expectedparrot/edsl):\n",
    "\n",
    "### From PyPI\n",
    "Install EDSL directly using `pip`, which is straightforward and recommended for most users. \n",
    "We also recommend using a virtual environment to manage your Python packages (see *Recommendations* above).\n",
    "Uncomment and run the following command to install EDSL from PyPI:"

    "## Accessing LLMs\n",
    "The next step is to decide how you want to access language models for running surveys.\n",
    "EDSL works with many popular language models that you can choose from to generate responses to your surveys.\n",
    "These models are hosted by various service providers, such as Anthropic, Azure, Bedrock, Deep Infra, Google, Groq, Mistral, OpenAI, Replicate and Together.\n",
    "In order to run a survey, you need to provide API keys for the service providers of models that you want to use.\n",
    "There are two methods for providing API keys to EDSL:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use an Expected Parrot API key to access all available models\n",
    "* Provide your own API keys from service providers\n",
    "\n",
    "## Create an account\n",
    "The easiest way to manage your keys is from your Expected Parrot account.\n",
    "[Create an account](https://www.expectedparrot.com/login) with an email address and then navigate to your [Settings](https://www.expectedparrot.com/home/settings) page to view your Expected Parrot API key. \n",
    "It is stored automatically and can be regenerated at any time.\n",
    "You will also see options for activating remote inference and caching; this allows your surveys to be run and your results to be stored remotely at the Expected Parrot server instead of your own machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Managing keys\n",
    "If you want to use your own keys to run surveys, navigate to your [Keys](https://www.expectedparrot.com/home/keys) page and use the options to add keys and optionally share access to them with other users. \n",
    "You can specify which keys to use at any time, and check the current priority of your keys. \n",
    "Your Expected Parrot API key is used by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please see [instructions](https://www.expectedparrot.com/getting-started/edsl-api-keys) for alternative methods of storing your own API keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note:* If you try to run a survey without storing a required API key, you will be provided a link to activate remote inference and use your Expected Parrot API key.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Credits & tokens\n",
    "Running surveys with language models requires tokens.\n",
    "If you are using your own API keys, service providers will bill you directly.\n",
    "If you are using your Expected Parrot API key to access models, you will need to purchase credits to cover token costs.\n",
    "Please see the model pricing page for details on available models and their current prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note:* Your account comes with 100 free credits. You can purchase more credits at any time at your [Credits](https://www.expectedparrot.com/home/credits) page.\n",
    "\n",
    "After installing EDSL and storing API keys you are ready to run some examples!"

This adds a `scenario` column to the results with a row for each answer to each question for each scenario.\n",
    "* In the former case, the `loop` method is used to create a list of versions of a question with the scenarios already added to it; when the questions are passed to a survey and it is run, the results include columns for each individual question; there is no `scenario` column and a single row for each agent's answers to all the questions.\n",
