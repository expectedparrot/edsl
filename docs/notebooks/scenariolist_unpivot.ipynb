    "# Using EDSL to sense check data\n",
    "This notebook provides example code for sense checking survey data using [EDSL](https://docs.expectedparrot.com), an open-source library for simulating surveys, experiments and market research with AI agents and large language models. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Contents\n",
    "Using a set of responses to a survey about online marketplaces as an example, we demonstrate EDSL methods for: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Evaluating survey questions (e.g., for clarity and improvements)\n",
    "2. Analyzing each respondent's set of answers (e.g., to summarize or identify sentiment, themes, etc.)\n",
    "3. Reviewing each answer individually (e.g., to evaluate its relevance or usefulness)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Coop\n",
    "We also show how to post EDSL questions, surveys, results and notebooks (like this one) to [Coop: an integrated platform for creating and sharing LLM-based research](https://www.expectedparrot.com/explore). \n",
    "\n",
    "## How EDSL works\n",
    "EDSL is a flexible library that can be used to perform a broad variety of research tasks. A typical workflow consists of the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Construct questions  \n",
    "* Add data to the questions (e.g., for data labeling tasks)\n",
    "* Use an AI agent to answer the questions\n",
    "* Select a language model to generate the answers\n",
    "* Analyze results in a formatted dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "## Technical setup\n",
    "Before running the code below please ensure that you have completed setup:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Install](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/installation.html) the EDSL library.\n",
    "* Create a [Coop account](https://www.expectedparrot.com/login) and activate [remote inference](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/remote_inference.html) OR store your own [API Keys](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/api_keys.html) for language models that you want to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our [Starter Tutorial](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/starter_tutorial.html) provides examples of EDSL basic components. "

       "Dataset([{'scenario.question': ['Can you describe a recent experience where you were dissatisfied with our service?', 'Respondent ID', 'What do you like most about using our online marketplace?', 'What is one feature you would like to see added to improve your shopping experience?', 'How do you feel about the current product search and filtering options?', 'Is there anything else you would like to share about your experience with us?']}, {'answer.logic': ['The question \"Can you describe a recent experience where you were dissatisfied with our service?\" has a few potential problems:\\n\\n* **Leading Question:**  It presupposes dissatisfaction exists.  Someone who had a positive experience might not answer honestly, or might struggle to recall a negative one even if a minor issue occurred.  A neutral question would be better.\\n\\n* **Ambiguity of \"recent\":**  \"Recent\" is subjective.  What constitutes \"recent\" for one person (e.g., last week) might be distant for another (e.g., last month).  Defining a timeframe (e.g., \"within the last month,\" \"since your last visit\") would improve clarity and comparability.\\n\\n* **Open-ended nature (potentially problematic):** While open-ended questions allow for rich responses, they can be difficult to analyze quantitatively.  The responses might be too varied to easily categorize and summarize.  Consider including a follow-up question with specific options (e.g., rating scales for different aspects of service).\\n\\n* **Assumes prior service interaction:**  The question assumes the respondent has actually used the service.  It might be beneficial to add a screening question first to determine if they have indeed interacted with the service.', '\"Respondent ID\" is not a survey question; it\\'s a field for identifying the respondent\\'s data.  It\\'s not meant to elicit an answer from the respondent, but rather to serve as a unique label for their responses.  Therefore, the problem isn\\'t logical or syntactical within the context of a question, but rather its inappropriate placement as a *question*.  It should be treated as a data field, not a question in the survey instrument.', 'The main problem with the question \"What do you like most about using our online marketplace?\" is that it\\'s **open-ended and lacks structure**.  This leads to several potential issues:\\n\\n* **Difficult to analyze:**  Responses will be highly varied and unstructured, making quantitative analysis nearly impossible.  It will be challenging to identify trends or common themes without significant manual coding and interpretation, which is time-consuming and prone to subjective bias.\\n\\n* **Potential for irrelevant answers:** Respondents might focus on aspects unrelated to the marketplace itself (e.g., \"I like online shopping in general\").  This dilutes the data and makes it harder to draw meaningful conclusions about the marketplace\\'s specific strengths.\\n\\n* **Bias towards positive responses:** The question only asks about what people *like* most. It doesn\\'t allow for feedback on negative aspects or areas for improvement.  A more balanced approach would include questions about both positive and negative experiences.\\n\\n* **Difficulty in comparing responses across different demographics:** The unstructured nature makes it hard to compare responses across different user groups (e.g., age, location, purchase frequency).\\n\\n\\nTo improve the question, consider using:\\n\\n* **Multiple choice questions:** Offer a pre-defined list of options (e.g., \"Ease of use,\" \"Product selection,\" \"Customer service,\" \"Price\").  This allows for easy quantification and comparison.\\n\\n* **Rating scales:**  Ask respondents to rate different aspects of the marketplace on a scale (e.g., 1-5 stars).\\n\\n* **A combination of open-ended and structured questions:**  Include an open-ended question *after* the structured questions to allow for more detailed feedback on specific aspects.  This approach captures both quantitative and qualitative data.', 'The main problem is that the question is **too broad and lacks structure**.  Here\\'s a breakdown:\\n\\n* **\"One feature\" is restrictive:**  Respondents might have multiple features they\\'d like to see added. Limiting them to just one could result in valuable feedback being lost or forcing them to choose arbitrarily between important improvements.\\n\\n* **Lack of guidance:** The question doesn\\'t provide any context or categories.  \"Improve your shopping experience\" is very vague.  A respondent might think of features related to website design, delivery, customer service, product selection, payment options, etc.  The lack of direction makes it difficult to analyze the results meaningfully, as answers will be scattered and difficult to group.\\n\\n* **Potential for open-ended, unanalyzable responses:** While open-ended questions can be valuable, this one is too open.  Responses could be too varied and descriptive, making it challenging to quantify or categorize the feedback effectively.\\n\\nIn short, the question needs more structure to be effective.  It would be better to either:\\n\\n* **Use multiple-choice questions:** Offer a list of pre-defined features in different categories.\\n* **Use a combination of multiple-choice and open-ended questions:** Allow respondents to choose from a list of common features and then add any other suggestions in a separate open-ended question.\\n* **Break down the question into smaller, more specific questions:** For example, ask separate questions about website usability, delivery options, customer service, etc.', 'The question \"How do you feel about the current product search and filtering options?\" suffers from several problems:\\n\\n* **Ambiguity and Vagueness:**  \"How do you feel\" is too broad.  It doesn\\'t specify what kind of feeling the respondent should express.  Do they want to know about satisfaction, ease of use, frustration, efficiency, or something else?  The question needs to target a specific feeling or aspect of the experience.\\n\\n* **Lack of Specificity:** \"Current product search and filtering options\" is also vague.  Are there multiple search and filtering options?  If so, the question should either break them down into separate questions or specify which options are being addressed.  Respondents might have different feelings about different aspects (e.g., the autocomplete feature vs. the advanced filters).\\n\\n* **Open-ended nature (potentially problematic):** While open-ended questions can provide rich qualitative data, they can also be difficult to analyze quantitatively and may lead to responses that are too varied to be useful.  For large-scale surveys, this question would be challenging to summarize and analyze effectively.\\n\\n\\nTo improve the question, it could be broken down into multiple more specific questions, such as:\\n\\n* \"How easy was it to find the products you were looking for using the search function?\" (Rating scale)\\n* \"How satisfied were you with the available filtering options?\" (Rating scale)\\n* \"Did you find the filtering options to be intuitive and easy to understand?\" (Yes/No or rating scale)\\n* \"What, if anything, could be improved about the product search function?\" (Open-ended, but now more focused)\\n* \"What, if anything, could be improved about the product filtering options?\" (Open-ended, but now more focused)', 'The question \"Is there anything else you would like to share about your experience with us?\" has a few potential problems, mostly related to its openness and lack of guidance:\\n\\n* **Too broad:**  It\\'s incredibly open-ended.  Respondents might share completely irrelevant information, making the data difficult to analyze and potentially overwhelming for the survey administrator.  It lacks focus.\\n\\n* **Potential for low response rate (or unhelpful responses):**  Many people might simply answer \"no\" or leave it blank because they don\\'t know where to begin or what kind of information is desired.  They might not feel comfortable providing unsolicited feedback without more direction.\\n\\n* **Bias towards positive feedback:** The phrasing is slightly positive (\"share about your experience\").  A more neutral phrasing might elicit a wider range of responses, including negative ones.\\n\\n* **Lack of context:**  \"With us\" is vague.  Depending on the context (company, product, service, etc.), it might be unclear what \"us\" refers to.  More specificity would be helpful.\\n\\n\\nTo improve the question, consider:\\n\\n* **Adding a specific focus:** Instead of \"anything else,\" specify the type of information you\\'re looking for (e.g., \"Is there anything else you\\'d like to share about the ease of use of our product?\", \"What could we have done better to improve your experience?\").\\n\\n* **Using a more neutral tone:** Replace phrases like \"share about your experience\" with something more neutral, such as \"any additional comments\" or \"anything else you would like to comment on.\"\\n\\n* **Providing response options:** Offer a few categories or prompts to guide respondents (e.g., \"Customer service,\" \"Product quality,\" \"Website usability\").  This could be combined with the open-ended question.']}, {'answer.improved': ['In the past month, have you had any experiences with our service?
