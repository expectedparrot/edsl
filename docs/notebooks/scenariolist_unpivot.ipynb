    "# Using EDSL to sense check data\n",
    "This notebook provides example code for sense checking survey data using [EDSL](https://docs.expectedparrot.com), an open-source library for simulating surveys, experiments and market research with AI agents and large language models. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Contents\n",
    "Using a set of responses to a survey about online marketplaces as an example, we demonstrate EDSL methods for: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Evaluating survey questions (e.g., for clarity and improvements)\n",
    "2. Analyzing each respondent's set of answers (e.g., to summarize or identify sentiment, themes, etc.)\n",
    "3. Reviewing each answer individually (e.g., to evaluate its relevance or usefulness)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Coop\n",
    "We also show how to post EDSL questions, surveys, results and notebooks (like this one) to the [Coop: a new platform for creating and sharing LLM-based research](https://www.expectedparrot.com/explore). \n",
    "\n",
    "## How EDSL works\n",
    "EDSL is a flexible library that can be used to perform a broad variety of research tasks. A typical workflow consists of the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Construct questions in EDSL \n",
    "* Add data to the questions (e.g., for data labeling tasks)\n",
    "* Use an AI agent to answer the questions\n",
    "* Select a language model to generate the answers\n",
    "* Analyze results in a formatted dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "## Technical setup\n",
    "Before running the code below please ensure that you have completed setup:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Install](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/installation.html) the EDSL library.\n",
    "* Create a [Coop account](https://www.expectedparrot.com/login) and activate [remote inference](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/remote_inference.html) OR store your own [API Keys](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/api_keys.html) for language models that you want to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our [Starter Tutorial](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/starter_tutorial.html) provides examples of EDSL basic components. "

       "1. **Limitation to One Feature**: The question restricts respondents to mentioning only one feature. This might limit the feedback you receive, as respondents may have multiple suggestions or ideas that could be valuable. Consider allowing respondents to list more than one feature or providing an option to elaborate further.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Ambiguity in &quot;Feature&quot;**: The term &quot;feature&quot; is somewhat vague and may be interpreted differently by different respondents. Some might think of website or app features, while others might consider in-store features or customer service improvements. Clarifying the context or providing examples could help ensure more focused and useful responses.\n",

However, some respondents might feel that improving existing features, services, or processes could be more beneficial. Consider rephrasing to allow for suggestions related to both new and existing features.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Lack of Specificity**: The question does not specify the type of shopping experience (e.g., online, in-store, or both). If the survey is aimed at a specific type of shopping experience, it would be helpful to include that context to gather more relevant feedback.               </td><td>What features or improvements would you suggest to enhance your online or in-store shopping experience?

       "\n",
       "1. **Ambiguity**: The question might be too broad or vague. &quot;Feel&quot; is a subjective term and can lead to varied interpretations. Respondents might not know if they should focus on emotional responses (like satisfaction or frustration) or practical ones (like ease of use or effectiveness).\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Lack of Specificity**: It combines two different elements—product search and filtering options—into one question. If respondents have different opinions on these two aspects, they may find it difficult to provide a single, coherent answer.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Open-ended Format**: While open-ended questions can provide rich data, they can also lead to varied responses that are difficult to analyze quantitatively. If the survey aims to gather quantitative data, it might be better to use a closed-ended question with specific response options.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Assumes Familiarity**: The question assumes that the respondent has used the product search and filtering options. If someone hasn&#x27;t used these features, they might not be able to provide a meaningful response.\n",
       "\n",
       "To address these issues, you might consider breaking the question into two separate questions and providing specific response options. For example:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. &quot;How satisfied are you with the current product search options?&quot;\n",

Depending on the survey\\'s goals, it might be helpful to provide some guidance on the type of information being sought.\\n\\n2. **Vagueness**: The phrase \"anything else\" is quite broad and might lead to a wide range of responses. If the survey aims to gather specific types of feedback, it could be helpful to specify or narrow down the focus.\\n\\n3. **Contextual Clarity**: Without context, respondents might be unsure about what aspects of their experience they should focus on. Adding context or examples could help guide responses.\\n\\n4. **Emotional Tone**: The question assumes a neutral tone, which is generally appropriate, but if the survey aims to capture emotional responses, it might benefit from a more empathetic or inviting wording.', 'The survey question \"Is there anything else you would like to share about your experience with us?\" is generally clear and straightforward, but there are a few considerations that could be addressed to improve its effectiveness:\\n\\n1. **Open-Ended Nature**: The question is open-ended, which can be beneficial for gathering detailed feedback but may also result in responses that are difficult to categorize or analyze.

Adding context or examples could help guide responses.\\n\\n4. **Emotional Tone**: The question assumes a neutral tone, which is generally appropriate, but if the survey aims to capture emotional responses, it might benefit from a more empathetic or inviting wording.', 'The survey question \"What is one feature you would like to see added to improve your shopping experience?\" is generally clear and straightforward, but there are a few potential issues to consider:\\n\\n1. **Limitation to One Feature**: The question restricts respondents to mentioning only one feature. This might limit the feedback you receive, as respondents may have multiple suggestions or ideas that could be valuable. Consider allowing respondents to list more than one feature or providing an option to elaborate further.\\n\\n2. **Ambiguity in \"Feature\"**: The term \"feature\" is somewhat vague and may be interpreted differently by different respondents. Some might think of website or app features, while others might consider in-store features or customer service improvements. Clarifying the context or providing examples could help ensure more focused and useful responses.\\n\\n3. **Assumption of Improvement**: The question assumes that adding a new feature is the best way to improve the shopping experience. However, some respondents might feel that improving existing features, services, or processes could be more beneficial. Consider rephrasing to allow for suggestions related to both new and existing features.\\n\\n4. **Lack of Specificity**: The question does not specify the type of shopping experience (e.g., online, in-store, or both). If the survey is aimed at a specific type of shopping experience, it would be helpful to include that context to gather more relevant feedback.', 'The survey question \"How do you feel about the current product search and filtering options?\" is generally clear, but it has a few potential issues that could be improved:\\n\\n1. **Ambiguity**: The question might be too broad or vague. \"Feel\" is a subjective term and can lead to varied interpretations. Respondents might not know if they should focus on emotional responses (like satisfaction or frustration) or practical ones (like ease of use or effectiveness).\\n\\n2. **Lack of Specificity**: It combines two different elements—product search and filtering options—into one question. If respondents have different opinions on these two aspects, they may find it difficult to provide a single, coherent answer.\\n\\n3. **Open-ended Format**: While open-ended questions can provide rich data, they can also lead to varied responses that are difficult to analyze quantitatively. If the survey aims to gather quantitative data, it might be better to use a closed-ended question with specific response options.\\n\\n4. **Assumes Familiarity**: The question assumes that the respondent has used the product search and filtering options. If someone hasn\\'t used these features, they might not be able to provide a meaningful response.\\n\\nTo address these issues, you might consider breaking the question into two separate questions and providing specific response options. For example:\\n\\n1. \"How satisfied are you with the current product search options?\"\\n   - Very satisfied\\n   - Satisfied\\n   - Neutral\\n   - Dissatisfied\\n   - Very dissatisfied\\n\\n2. \"How satisfied are you with the current filtering options?\"\\n   - Very satisfied\\n   - Satisfied\\n   - Neutral\\n   - Dissatisfied\\n   - Very dissatisfied', 'The survey question \"Respondent ID\" has a few issues:\\n\\n1. **Lack of Clarity**: The phrase \"Respondent ID\" is not a question.
