    "# Using EDSL to sense check data\n",
    "This notebook provides example code for sense checking survey data using [EDSL](https://docs.expectedparrot.com), an open-source library for simulating surveys, experiments and market research with AI agents and large language models. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Contents\n",
    "Using a set of responses to a survey about online marketplaces as an example, we demonstrate EDSL methods for: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Evaluating survey questions (e.g., for clarity and improvements)\n",
    "2. Analyzing each respondent's set of answers (e.g., to summarize or identify sentiment, themes, etc.)\n",
    "3. Reviewing each answer individually (e.g., to evaluate its relevance or usefulness)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Coop\n",
    "We also show how to post EDSL questions, surveys, results and notebooks (like this one) to [Coop: an integrated platform for creating and sharing LLM-based research](https://www.expectedparrot.com/explore). \n",
    "\n",
    "## How EDSL works\n",
    "EDSL is a flexible library that can be used to perform a broad variety of research tasks. A typical workflow consists of the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Construct questions  \n",
    "* Add data to the questions (e.g., for data labeling tasks)\n",
    "* Use an AI agent to answer the questions\n",
    "* Select a language model to generate the answers\n",
    "* Analyze results in a formatted dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "## Technical setup\n",
    "Before running the code below please ensure that you have completed setup:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Install](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/installation.html) the EDSL library.\n",
    "* Create a [Coop account](https://www.expectedparrot.com/login) and activate [remote inference](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/remote_inference.html) OR store your own [API Keys](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/api_keys.html) for language models that you want to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our [Starter Tutorial](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/starter_tutorial.html) provides examples of EDSL basic components. "
