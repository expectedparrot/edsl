    "# Using PDFs in a survey\n",
    "This notebook provides sample [EDSL](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/) code demonstrating a method `from_pdf()` that imports a PDF and automatically creates `Scenario` objects for the pages to use as parameters of survey questions. This can be helpful when using EDSL to extract qualitative information from a large text efficiently. \n",
    "\n",
    "EDSL is an open-source library for simulating surveys and experiments with AI agents and large language models. Please see our [documentation page](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/) for tips and tutorials on getting started.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How it works\n",
    "EDSL comes with a [variety of question types](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/questions.html) that we can select from based on the desired form of the response (multiple choice, free text, etc.). We can also parameterize questions with textual content in order to ask questions about it. We do this by creating a `{{ placeholder }}` in a question text, e.g., *What are the key themes of this text: {{ text }}*, and then creating `Scenario` objects for the content to be inserted in the placeholder when we run the survey. This allows us to administer multiple versions of a question with different inputs all at once. A common use case for this is performing [data labeling tasks](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/notebooks/data_labeling_example.html) designed as questions about one or more pieces of textual data that can be inserted into the survey question texts. [Learn more about using scenarios](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/scenarios.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "For purposes of demonstration we use a PDF copy of the first page of the recent paper [Automated Social Science:\n",
    "Language Models as Scientist and Subjects](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11794) and conduct a survey consisting of several questions about the contents of it:\n",

Manning†\\nMIT\\nKehang Zhu†\\nHarvard\\nJohn J. Horton\\nMIT & NBER\\nApril 26, 2024\\nAbstract\\nWe present an approach for automatically generating and testing, in silico,\\nsocial scientific hypotheses. This automation is made possible by recent ad-\\nvances in large language models (LLM), but the key feature of the approach\\nis the use of structural causal models. Structural causal models provide a lan-\\nguage to state hypotheses, a blueprint for constructing LLM-based agents, an\\nexperimental design, and a plan for data analysis. The fitted structural causal\\nmodel becomes an object available for prediction or the planning of follow-on\\nexperiments. We demonstrate the approach with several scenarios: a nego-\\ntiation, a bail hearing, a job interview, and an auction. In each case, causal\\nrelationships are both proposed and tested by the system, finding evidence\\nfor some and not others. We provide evidence that the insights from these\\nsimulations of social interactions are not available to the LLM purely through\\ndirect elicitation. When given its proposed structural causal model for each\\nscenario, the LLM is good at predicting the signs of estimated effects, but\\nit cannot reliably predict the magnitudes of those estimates. In the auction\\nexperiment, the in silico simulation results closely match the predictions of\\nauction theory, but elicited predictions of the clearing prices from the LLM\\nare inaccurate. However, the LLM’s predictions are dramatically improved if\\nthe model can condition on the fitted structural causal model. In short, the\\nLLM knows more than it can (immediately) tell.\\n∗Thanks to generous support from Drew Houston and his AI for Augmentation and Productivity\\nseed grant.
