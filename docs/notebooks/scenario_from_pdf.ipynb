    "# Using PDFs in a survey\n",
    "This notebook provides sample [EDSL](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/) code demonstrating a method `from_pdf()` that imports a PDF and automatically creates `Scenario` objects for the pages to use as parameters of survey questions. This can be helpful when using EDSL to extract qualitative information from a large text efficiently. \n",
    "\n",
    "EDSL is an open-source library for simulating surveys and experiments with AI agents and large language models. Please see our [documentation page](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/) for tips and tutorials on getting started.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How it works\n",
    "EDSL comes with a [variety of question types](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/questions.html) that we can select from based on the desired form of the response (multiple choice, free text, etc.). We can also parameterize questions with textual content in order to ask questions about it. We do this by creating a `{{ placeholder }}` in a question text, e.g., *What are the key themes of this text: {{ text }}*, and then creating `Scenario` objects for the content to be inserted in the placeholder when we run the survey. This allows us to administer multiple versions of a question with different inputs all at once. A common use case for this is performing [data labeling tasks](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/notebooks/data_labeling_example.html) designed as questions about one or more pieces of textual data that can be inserted into the survey question texts. [Learn more about using scenarios](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/scenarios.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "For purposes of demonstration we use a PDF copy of the first page of the recent paper [Automated Social Science:\n",
    "Language Models as Scientist and Subjects](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11794) and conduct a survey consisting of several questions about the contents of it:\n",

Previously, developing such models and hypotheses to test was exclusively\\na human task. This is changing as researchers have begun to explore automated\\nhypothesis generation through the use of machine learning.1 But even with novel\\nmachine-generated hypotheses, there is still the problem of testing.\\nA potential\\nsolution is simulation. Researchers have shown that Large Language Models (LLM)\\ncan simulate humans as experimental subjects with surprising degrees of realism.2\\nTo the extent that these simulation results carry over to human subjects in out-of-\\nsample tasks, they provide another option for testing (Horton, 2023). In this paper,\\nwe combine these ideas—automated hypothesis generation and automated in silico\\nhypothesis testing—by using LLMs for both purposes. We demonstrate that such\\nautomation is possible. We evaluate the approach by comparing results to a setting\\nwhere the real-world predictions are well known and test to see if an LLM can be\\nused to generate information that it cannot access through direct elicitation.\\nThe key innovation in our approach is the use of structural causal models to orga-\\nnize the research process. Structural causal models are mathematical representations\\nof cause and effect (Pearl, 2009b; Wright, 1934) and have long offered a language\\nfor expressing hypotheses.3 What is novel in our paper is the use of these models\\nas a blueprint for the design of agents and experiments. In short, each explanatory\\nvariable describes something about a person or scenario that has to vary for the effect\\nto be identified, so the system “knows” it needs to generate agents or scenarios that\\n1A few examples include generative adversarial networks to formulate new hypotheses (Ludwig\\nand Mullainathan, 2023), algorithms to find anomalies in formal theories (Mullainathan and Ram-\\nbachan, 2023), reinforcement learning to propose tax policies (Zheng et al., 2022), random forests\\nto identify heterogenous treatment effects (Wager and Athey, 2018), and several others (Buyalskaya\\net al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023; Enke and Shubatt, 2023; Girotra et al., 2023; Peterson et al., 2021).\\n2(Aher et al., 2023; Argyle et al., 2023; Bakker et al., 2022; Binz and Schulz, 2023b; Brand et\\nal., 2023; Bubeck et al., 2023; Fish et al., 2023; Mei et al., 2024; Park et al., 2023)\\n3In an unfortunate clash of naming conventions, some disciplines have alternative definitions\\nfor the term “structural” when discussing formal models. Here, structural does not refer to the\\ndefinition traditionally used in economics. See Appendix B for a more detailed explanation.\\n2\\n'}), Scenario({'filename': 'tmp9grtwdcg.pdf', 'page': 3, 'text': 'vary on that dimension—a straightforward transition from stated theory to experi-\\nmental design and data generation. Furthermore, the structural causal model offers\\na pre-specified plan for estimation (Haavelmo, 1943, 1944; J¨oreskog, 1970).\\nWe built an open-source computational system implementing this structural causal\\nmodel-based approach. The system can automatically generate hypotheses, design\\nexperiments, run those experiments on independent LLM-powered agents, and ana-\\nlyze the results. We use this system to explore several social scenarios: (1) two people\\nbargaining over a mug, (2) a bail hearing for tax fraud, (3) a lawyer interviewing\\nfor a job, and (4) an open ascending price auction with private values for a piece\\nof art. We allow the system to propose the hypotheses for the first two scenarios\\nand then run the experimental simulations without intervention. For (3) and (4),\\nwe demonstrate the system’s ability to accommodate human input at any point by\\nselecting the hypotheses ourselves and editing some of the agents, but otherwise, we\\nallow the system to proceed autonomously.\\nThough yet to be optimized for novelty, the system formulates and tests multiple\\nfalsifiable hypotheses—from which it generates several findings. The probability of\\na deal increased as the seller’s sentimental attachment to the mug decreased, and\\nboth the buyer’s and the seller’s reservation prices mattered. A remorseful defendant\\nwas granted lower bail but was not so fortunate if his criminal history was exten-\\nsive. However, the judge’s case count before the hearing—which was hypothesized\\nto matter—did not affect the final bail amount. The candidate passing the bar exam\\nwas the only important factor in her getting the job. Neither the candidate’s height\\nnor the interviewer’s friendliness affected the outcome.\\nThe auction scenario is particularly illuminating. An increase in the bidders’\\nreservation prices caused an increase in the clearing price, a clearing price that is\\nalways close to the second-highest reservation amongst the bidders. These simula-\\ntion results closely match the theory (Maskin and Riley, 1985) and what has been\\nobserved empirically (Athey et al., 2011).\\nNone of the findings from the system’s experiments are “counterintuitive,” but\\nit is important to emphasize they were the result of empiricism, not just model\\nintrospection.\\nHowever, this does raise the question of whether the simulations\\n3\\n'}), Scenario({'filename': 'tmp9grtwdcg.pdf', 'page': 4, 'text': 'are even necessary.4\\nInstead of simulation, could an LLM simply do a “thought\\nexperiment” about the proposed in silico experiment and achieve the same insight?\\nTo test this idea, we describe the experiments that will be simulated and ask the\\nLLM to predict the results—both the path estimates and point predictions. The\\npath estimates being the coefficients in the linear structural causal model. To make\\nthis concrete, suppose we had the simple linear model y = Xβ to describe some\\nscenario, and we ran an experiment to estimate ˆβ. We describe the scenario and the\\nexperiment to the LLM and ask it to predict yi given a particular Xi (a “predict-yi”\\ntask). Separately, we ask it to predict ˆβ (a “predict-ˆβ” task). Later, we examine\\nhow the LLM does on the predict-yi task when it has access to the fitted structural\\ncausal model (i.e., ˆβ).\\nIn the predict-yi task, we prompt the LLM to predict the outcome yi given each\\npossible combination of the Xi’s from the auction experiment. Direct elicitation of\\nthe predictions for yi in the auction experiment is wildly inaccurate. The predictions\\nare even further from the theory than the empirical results.\\nIn the predict-ˆβ task, the LLM is asked to predict the fitted structural causal\\nmodel’s path estimates for all four experiments, provided with contextual information\\nabout each scenario. On average, the LLM predicts the path estimates are 13.2 times\\nlarger than the experimental results. Its predictions are overestimates for 10 out of\\n12 of the paths, although they are generally in the correct direction.\\nWe repeat the predict-yi task, but this time, we provide the LLM with the ex-\\nperimental path estimates. For each Xi, we fit the structural causal model using\\nall but the ith observation and then ask the LLM to predict yi given Xi and this\\nfitted model. In this “predict-yi|ˆβ−i” task, the predictions are far better than in the\\npredict-yi task without the fitted model. The mean squared error is six times lower,\\nand the predictions are much closer to those made by the theory, but they are still\\nfurther from the theory than they are to the simulations.\\nWe design and implement an approach to automated social science because LLMs\\npossess latent information about human behavior that can be systematically explored\\nand extracted (Burns et al., 2023; Scherrer et al., 2024).

Section\\n5 discusses the advantages of using SCMs over other methods for studying causal\\nrelationships in simulations of social interactions. The paper concludes in Section 6.\\n2\\nOverview of the system\\nTo perform this automated social science, we needed to build a system. The system\\nintentionally mirrors the experimental social scientific process. These steps are, in\\nbroad strokes:\\n1. Social scientists start by selecting a topic or domain to study (e.g., misinfor-\\nmation, auctions, bargaining, etc).\\n2. Within the domain, they identify interesting outcomes and some causes that\\nmight affect the outcomes. These variables and their proposed relationships\\nare the hypotheses.\\n3. They design an experiment to test these hypotheses by inducing variation in\\nthe causes and measuring the outcomes.\\n5\\n'}), Scenario({'filename': 'tmp9grtwdcg.pdf', 'page': 6, 'text': '4. After designing the experiment, social scientists determine how they will ana-\\nlyze the data in a pre-analysis plan.\\n5. Next, they recruit participants, run the experiment, and collect the data.\\n6. Finally, they analyze the data per the pre-analysis plan to estimate the rela-\\ntionships between the proposed causes and outcomes.\\nWhile any given social scientist might not follow this sequence exactly, whatever\\ntheir approach may be, the first two steps should always guide the later steps—the\\ndevelopment of the hypothesis guides the experimental design and model estimation.\\nOf course, many social scientists must often omit steps 3-5 when a controlled exper-\\niment is not possible, but they typically have some notion of the experiment they\\nwould like to run.\\nTo build our system, we formalized a sequence of these steps analogous to those\\nlisted above. The system executes them autonomously. Since the system uses AI\\nagents instead of human subjects, it can always design and execute an experiment.\\nStructural causal models (SCM) are essential to the design of the system because\\nthey make unambiguous causal statements, which allow for unambiguous estimation\\nand experimental design.5 Algorithms can determine precisely which variables must\\nbe exogenously manipulated to identify the effect of a given cause (Pearl, 2009b). If\\nthe first two steps in the social scientific process are building the SCM, the last four\\ncan be directly determined subject to the SCM. Such precision makes automation\\npossible as the system only relies on a few key early decisions. Otherwise, the space\\nof possible choices for the latter steps would explode, making automation infeasible.\\nThe system is implemented in Python and uses GPT-4 for all LLM queries.\\nIts decisions are editable at every step.\\nThe overview in this section is a high-\\nlevel description of the system, but there are many more specific design choices and\\nprogramming details in Appendix A. For the purposes of most readers, the high-\\n5We use simple linear SCMs unless stated otherwise. This assumption is not necessarily correct\\nbut offers an unequivocal starting point to generate hypotheses. Functional assumptions can be\\ntested by comparing fitted SCMs with various forms using data generated from a known causal\\nstructure. Section B in the appendix provides a more detailed explanation of SCMs.\\n6\\n'}), Scenario({'filename': 'tmp9grtwdcg.pdf', 'page': 7, 'text': 'level overview should be sufficient to understand the system’s process, the results we\\npresent in Section 3, and the additional analyses in Sections 4 and 5.\\nThe system takes as input some scenario of social scientific interest: a negotia-\\ntion, a bail decision, a job interview, an auction, and so on.

Suppose the social scenario is “two people\\nbargaining over a mug.” The LLM may generate whether a deal occurs for the\\nmug as an outcome, and operationalizes the outcome as a binary variable with\\na ‘‘1’’ when a deal occurs and a ‘‘0’’ when it does not.\\nIt then gener-\\nates potential exogenous causes and their operationalizations: the buyer’s budget,\\nwhich is operationalized as the buyer’s willingness to pay in dollars. The\\nsystem takes each of these variables, constructs an SCM (see the second step in Fig-\\nure 1), and stores the relevant information about the operationalizations associated\\nwith each variable.78 From this point on, the SCM serves as a blueprint for the rest\\nof the process, namely the automatic instantiation of agents, their interaction, and\\nthe estimation of the linear paths.\\nThe second step is to construct the relevant agents—the Buyer and the Seller\\nin Figure 1, step 3. By “construct,” we mean that the system prompts indepen-\\ndent LLMs to be people with sets of attributes. These attributes are the exogenous\\ndimensions of the SCM, dimensions that are varied in each simulation. I.e., the dif-\\nferent experimental conditions. For the current scenario, a Budget is provided to the\\nbuyer that can take on values of {$5, $10, $20, $40}. By simulating interactions\\nof agents that vary on the exogenous dimensions of the SCM, the data generated can\\nbe used to fit the SCM.\\nNext, the system generates survey questions to gather data about the outcomes\\n6When we say “query an LLM,” we mean this literally. We have written a prompt that the\\nsystem provides to an LLM with the scenario.\\nFor example, the prompt used to generate the\\nrelevant agents is: In the following scenario: “{scenario}”, who are the individual human agents in\\na simple simulation of this scenario? Where “{scenario}” is replaced with the scenario of interest.\\nThe LLM then returns a list of agents, which are stored in the system and can be used in follow-on\\nprompts, prompts that generate things like the outcomes and proposed causes. The system contains\\nover 50 pre-written scenario-neutral prompts to gather all the information needed to generate the\\nSCM, run the experiment, and analyze the results.\\n7The system generates several other pieces of information about each variable, which help guide\\nthe experimental design and data analysis. See Appendix A for further details.\\n8The graph in the second step of Figure 1 is a directed acyclic graph (DAG).

LLMs are designed\\nto generate text in sequence. Since independent LLMs power each agent, one agent\\nmust finish speaking before the next begins. This necessitates a turn-taking protocol\\nto simulate the conversation. We programmed a menu of six ordering protocols,\\nfrom which an LLM is queried to select the most appropriate for a given scenario.\\nWe describe each protocol in Appendix A, and they are presented in Figure A.2,\\nbut in our bargaining scenario with two agents, there are only two possible ways for\\nthe agents to alternate speaking.

The speaking order can be flexible in\\nmore complex simulations with more agents, such as an auction or a bail hearing.\\nNow, the system runs the experiment. The conditions are simulated in parallel\\n(step 5 in Figure 1), each with a different value for the exogenous dimensions of the\\nSCM—the possible budgets for the buyer.\\nThe system must also determine when to stop the simulations.

We set two stopping conditions for the simulations. After each agent\\nspeaks in a simulation, an external LLM is prompted with the transcript of the\\nconversation and asked if the conversation should continue. If yes, the next agent\\nspeaks; otherwise, the simulation ends. Additionally, we limit the total number of\\nagent statements to twenty.

The\\nexperiments from Section 3 provided us with estimates for ˆβ (a k × 1 vector). We\\ndescribe the scenario and the experiment to the LLM and ask it to independently\\npredict yi given each Xi (a predict-yi task) as well as to predict ˆβ (a predict-ˆβ task).\\nThe LLM’s yi predictions are highly inaccurate compared to those from auction\\ntheory, which predicts that the clearing price will be the second highest valuation in\\nan open-ascending price auction with private values (Maskin and Riley, 1985). The\\nLLM is also unable to accurately predict the path estimates (ˆβ) of the fitted SCM.\\nFinally, we examine how the LLM does on the predict-yi task when provided with an\\nSCM fit on all of the data except for the corresponding Xi (the predict-yi|ˆβ−i task).\\nWhile the additional information dramatically improves the LLM’s predictions, they\\nare still less accurate than those made by auction theory.\\n10All predictions are made by the LLM once at temperature 0. When we elicit these predictions\\nmany times at higher temperatures, the results are similar.\\n18\\n'}), Scenario({'filename': 'tmp9grtwdcg.pdf', 'page': 19, 'text': '4.1\\nPredicting yi\\nFor various bidder reservation price combinations in the auction experiment, we\\nsupply the LLM with a prompt detailing the simulation and experimental design.11\\nWe then ask the LLM to predict the clearing price for the auction.

Despite no explicit instructions to do so, the agents in the\\nsimulation produce many human-like behaviors, such as throwing parties, going on\\ndates, and making friends.\\nWhile impressive and informative, a problem with such open-ended social simu-\\nlations is that selecting and analyzing outcomes can be difficult. To unveil insights,\\nresearchers may need to comb through thousands of lines of unstructured text. If\\nthey are interested in casual relationships, they may need to infer the causal struc-\\nture ex-post, which can be problematic. In contrast, the SCM framework describes\\nexactly what needs to be measured as a downstream outcome subject to the exoge-\\nnous manipulations of the cause. Identification is guaranteed. In this section, we\\n16It is also less accurate than the mechanical predictions made by the fitted SCM using the same\\nprocedure MSEMechanistic:yi| ˆβ−i = 725. Maybe the LLM cannot do the math, is still conditioning\\non other information beyond the path estimates when making its predictions, or, like humans, is\\nignoring relevant information when making choices (Handel and Schwartzstein, 2018).\\n17When we do fit this SCM (see Figure A.9), the coefficient is close to one (β = 0.912), and\\nalmost all the variance in the outcome is explained (R2 = 0.977).\\n22\\n'}), Scenario({'filename': 'tmp9grtwdcg.pdf', 'page': 23, 'text': 'discuss how assuming or searching for causal structure in observational data, the\\ntype generated from massive open-ended simulations can lead to misidentification\\nand how using SCMs avoids this problem.\\n5.1\\nAssuming causal structure from data\\nAll estimates in the fitted SCMs in Section 3 are unbiased.

For example,\\nin the bargaining experiment, perhaps we are interested in the length of the con-\\nversation as an outcome, even though it was not a part of the original SCM. The\\nconversation length can be operationalized as the sum of the number of statements\\nmade by all agents, and we can use the transcript from the finished experiment to\\nmeasure it.

This approach can be further improved by penalizing the model\\nfor complexity (based on additional criteria) and removing edges until the model is\\ngreedily optimized.

We also showed that such simulations produce results that are highly con-\\nsistent with theoretical predictions made by the relevant economic theory. In this\\nfinal section, we will discuss why such systems could be useful and identify areas for\\nfuture research.\\n6.1\\nControlled experimentation at scale\\nHow might systems like the one presented in this paper be useful for social science\\nresearch? One view is that these simulations are simple dress rehearsals for “real”\\nsocial science. A more expansive and exciting view is that these simulations would\\nyield insights that sometimes generalize to the real world.\\nThis is a view that sees these agents as a step forward in representing humans\\nfar beyond classical methods in agent-based modeling, such as those used to explore\\nhow individual preferences can lead to surprising social patterns (Schelling, 1969,\\n27\\n'}), Scenario({'filename': 'tmp9grtwdcg.pdf', 'page': 28, 'text': '1971).24 This view would mirror recent advances in the use of machine learning for\\nprotein folding (Jumper et al., 2021) and material discovery (Merchant et al., 2023).\\nThe system presented in this paper can generate these controlled experimental\\nsimulations en masse with prespecified plans for data collection and analysis. That\\ncontrasts most academic social science research as currently practiced (Almaatouq\\net al., 2022).25 This contrast is important. In the social sciences, context can heavily\\ninfluence results. Outcomes that hold true for one population may not for another.\\nEven within the same population, a change in environment can nullify or flip re-\\nsults (Lerner et al., 2004). Studying humans is also expensive and time-consuming,\\nwhich makes rapid, inexpensive, and replicable exploration valuable. There is still,\\nof course, the fundamental jump from simulations to human subjects.\\n6.2\\nInteractivity\\nThe system allows a scientist to monitor its entire process.\\nShould a researcher\\ndisagree with or be uncertain about a decision made by the system, they can probe\\nthe system regarding its choice. This allows the researcher to either (1) understand\\nwhy the decision was made, (2) ask the system to come up with a different option\\nfor that decision, or (3) input their own custom choice for that decision.\\nA researcher can even ignore much of the automation process and fill in the details\\nthemselves. They can choose the variables of interest, their operationalizations, the\\nattributes of the agents, how the agents interact, or customize the statistical analysis,\\namong other decision points. Different parts of the system can also accommodate\\ndifferent types of LLMs simultaneously. For example, a researcher could use GPT-\\n4 to generate hypotheses and Llama-2-70B to power the agents’ simulated social\\ninteractions.\\n24See Horton (2023) for a full discussion on the differences between traditional agent-based mod-\\neling and the use of LLM-powered agents. This position reflects our views as it was written recently\\nby some of the authors of this paper.\\n25When a group of social scientists has the same data set on some human behavior or outcome,\\nthey can reach very different conclusions when analyzing it independently (Engzell, 2023; Salganik\\net al., 2020).\\n28\\n'}), Scenario({'filename': 'tmp9grtwdcg.pdf', 'page': 29, 'text': '6.3\\nReplicability\\nReplicating social science experiments with human subjects can be difficult (Camerer\\net al., 2018).

In contrast, the system allows for nearly\\nfrictionless communication and replication of the experimental design.\\nThe system’s entire procedure is exportable as a JSON file with the fitted SCM.26\\nThis JSON includes every decision the system makes, including natural language\\nexplanations for the choices and the transcripts from each simulation.

Other scientists could inspect,\\nreplicate the experiment, or extend the work.\\n6.4\\nFuture research\\nWhile designing our system, we encountered several areas for new research. First is\\nthe problem of “which attributes” to endow an LLM-powered agent beyond those im-\\nmediately relevant to the proposed exogenous variables. For example, demographic\\ninformation, personalities, and other traits are not included in the agent’s attributes\\nunless they are a part of the SCM. To improve the fidelity of the simulations, it\\nmight make sense to add some or all of these attributes to the agents. However, it\\nis unclear how to optimize this process.\\nSecond, we encountered the problem of engineering social interactions between\\nLLM agents. LLMs are designed to exchange text in sequence, necessitating a pro-\\ntocol for turn-taking that reflects the natural ebb and flow of human conversation.\\nIn an initial attempt to address this problem, we created a menu of flexible agent-\\nordering mechanisms. We also introduced an additional LLM-powered agent into our\\nversion of the system whom we dub the ‘coordinator.” The coordinator functions\\nas a quasi-omniscient assistant who can read through transcripts and make choices\\n26A JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a data format that is easy for humans to read and\\nwrite and easy for machines to parse and generate.

When we say “query an LLM,” we mean this quite literally.\\nWe have written a scenario-neutral prompt that the system provides to an LLM with\\nthe scenario added to the prompt. The prompt is scenario-neutral because we can\\nreuse it for any scenario. The prompt takes the following format:\\nIn the following scenario: “{scenario description}”, Who are the in-\\ndividual human agents in a simple simulation of this scenario?\\nwhere {scenario description} is replaced with the scenario of interest. The LLM\\nthen returns a list of agents relevant to the scenario, and we have various checking\\nmechanisms to ensure the LLM’s response is valid.\\nThe system contains over 50 pre-written scenario-neutral prompts to gather all\\nthe information needed to generate the SCM, run the experiment, and analyze the\\nresults. These prompts have placeholders for the necessary information aggregated\\nin the system’s memory as it progresses through the different parts of the process.\\nA.1\\nConstructing variables and drawing causal paths\\nThe system builds SCMs variable-by-variable. It queries an LLM for an outcome\\ninvolving the agents in the social scenario of interest.\\nWe refer to outcomes as\\nendogenous variables because their values are realized during the experiment. This\\ncontrasts exogenous variables, the causes, whose values are determined before the\\nexperiment.\\nThe system queries the LLM for a list of possible exogenous causes of the en-\\ndogenous variable, generating a hypothesis as an SCM.27 Exogenous variables serve\\nas inputs to the experiment, whose values can be deterministically manipulated to\\nidentify causal effects. The system assumes that when an exogenous variable causes\\nan endogenous variable, a single causal path is proposed from the exogenous variable\\n27There is growing evidence that LLMs can be quite good at coming up with ideas and generating\\nhypotheses (Girotra et al., 2023; Rosenbusch et al., 2023).\\n39\\n'}), Scenario({'filename': 'tmp9grtwdcg.pdf', 'page': 40, 'text': 'to the endogenous variable. More formally, the system always generates SCMs as a\\nsimple linear model. The system currently generates all SCMs with one endogenous\\nvariable and as many exogenous causes as a researcher desires. We do little optimiza-\\ntion here, although the system can test for interaction terms. In future iterations\\nof the system, a researcher could choose outcomes and causes they are interested\\nin, score hypotheses by interestingness, and generate more complex hypotheses with\\nmediating endogenous variables.28\\nA.1.1\\nEndogenous outcomes\\nFor each endogenous variable, the system generates an operationalization, a type, the\\nunits, the possible levels, the explicit questions that need to be asked to measure the\\nvariable’s realized value, and how the answers to those questions will be aggregated\\nto get the final data for analysis. Examples of all information collected about the\\nvariables in an SCM are provided in Table A.3. Each piece of information about a\\nvariable is stored by the system and is then used to determine subsequent informa-\\ntion in consecutive scenario-neutral prompts. This is a kind of “chain-of-thoughts\\nprompting”, or the process of breaking down a complex prompt into a series of sim-\\npler prompts. This method can dramatically improve the quality and robustness of\\nan LLM’s performance (Wei et al., 2022).\\nThe first piece of information determined for each endogenous variable is the\\noperationalization. That is, how the possible realizations of said variable can be\\ndirectly mapped to measurable outcomes that can be observed and quantified. Sup-\\npose the outcome variable is whether or not a deal occurred from the SCM in\\nFigure 2b.29 The system could operationalize this as a binary variable, where ‘‘1’’\\nmeans a deal occurred and ‘‘0’’ does not. It then stores this information and\\nuses it in a scenario-neutral prompt to choose the variable type.\\nAll variables are determined to be one of five mutually exclusive “types.” These\\n28Parallel and crossover experimental designs can be used to identify mediating causal relation-\\nships (Imai et al., 2012). These experiments require few assumptions, which are often more plausible\\nwhen researchers have more control over the experiment, as they usually do with LLMs.\\n29We continue the practice from Section 2 of using typewriter text to denote example infor-\\nmation from the system.\\n40\\n'}), Scenario({'filename': 'tmp9grtwdcg.pdf', 'page': 41, 'text': 'are continuous, ordinal, nominal, binary, or count. By selecting a unique type for\\neach variable, the system can accommodate different distributions when estimating\\nthe fitted SCM after the experiment.\\nEach variable also has units. The units are the specific measure or standard used\\nto represent the variable’s quantified value. This information is used to improve the\\nrobustness and consistency of the system’s output when querying the LLM for other\\ninformation about a variable.\\nThe levels of the variable represent all of the values the variable can realize in\\na short list. They can take on different forms depending on the variable type, but\\nthey all follow a general pattern where they are defined by the range and nature of\\na variable’s possible values.30\\nTo measure the endogenous outcome, the system generates survey questions for\\none of the agents.\\nFor example, to measure whether or not a deal occurred,\\nthe system could ask the buyer or the seller, “Did you agree to buy the mug?”\\nOr, if the endogenous variable was the final price of the mug, the system could\\nask one of the agents, “How much did you sell the mug for?” Even though the\\nsimulations have yet to be conducted, the system generates survey questions. As\\nwith pre-registration, this reduces unneeded degrees of freedom in the data collection\\nprocess after the experiment.\\nMost endogenous variables are measured with only one question. In this case,\\nthe answer to this question is the only information needed to quantify the variable.\\nSometimes, it takes more than one survey question to measure a variable. Maybe the\\nvariable is the average satisfaction of the buyer and the seller; a variable\\nthat requires two separate measurements to quantify. In this case, the system gener-\\nates separate measurement questions to elicit the buyer’s and the seller’s satisfaction.\\nThen, the system averages the answers to the questions to measure the variable.\\n30For binary variables, the levels are the two possible outcomes. For ordinal variables, the levels\\ninclude all possible values that the ordinal variable could take on as determined by its operational-\\nization.\\nThe levels are selected for count and continuous variables by segmenting the range of\\npossible values into discrete intervals. In cases where the variable does not have a defined maxi-\\nmum or minimum, categories such as “above X” or “below Y” are included to ensure all possible\\nvalues are covered.\\n41\\n'}), Scenario({'filename': 'tmp9grtwdcg.pdf', 'page': 42, 'text': 'We pre-programmed a menu of 6 mechanical aggregation methods: finding the\\nminimum, maximum, average, mode, median, or sum of a list of values.

Then, the system uses a\\npre-written Python function to perform said aggregation. We refrain from asking\\nthe LLM to perform mathematical functions whenever possible, as they often make\\nmistakes.\\nA.1.2\\nExogenous causes\\nBesides the explicit measurement questions and data aggregation method, the system\\ncollects the same information for the exogenous variables as it does for the endogenous\\nvariables. For exogenous variables, these two pieces of information are unnecessary\\nfor measurement. In each simulation of the social scenario, a different combination\\nof the values of the exogenous variables is initialized. This is how the system induces\\nvariation in an experiment, so the treatments are always known to the system ex-\\nante.\\nCausal variables can have one of two possible “scopes.” The scope can be specific\\nto an individual agent or the scenario as a whole. This scope determines how the\\nsystem induces variation in the exogenous variables—at the agent or scenario level.\\nIndividual-level variables are further designated as either public or private. If private,\\nthe variable’s values are only provided to one agent; if public, they are treated as\\ncommon knowledge to all agents in the scenario.\\nThe system induces variation in the exogenous variables by transforming them\\ninto manageable proxy attributes for the agents. The system queries an LLM to cre-\\nate a second-person phrasing of the operationalized variable provided to the agent\\n(or agents, depending on the scope). For instance, with the buyer’s budget vari-\\nable, the attribute could be “your budget” for the buyer. These attributes will be\\nassigned to the agents, which we discuss in Section A.2.\\nWith the proxy attribute for the variable, the system queries an LLM for possible\\nvalues the attribute can take on. These are the induced variations—the treatment\\n42\\n'}), Scenario({'filename': 'tmp9grtwdcg.pdf', 'page': 43, 'text': 'conditions for the simulated experiments. By default, the system uses the levels, or a\\nvalue within each level, of the variable for the possible variation values. For example,\\nthese could be {$5, $10, $20, $40} for the buyer’s budget.\\nA.2\\nBuilding hypothesis-driven agents\\nIn conventional social science research, human subjects are catch as catch can. Here,\\nwe have to construct them from scratch. By “construct” we mean that we prompt\\nan LLM to be a person with a set of attributes. This is quite literal; for example,\\nwe could construct an agent in a negotiating scenario with the following prompt:\\n“You are a buyer in a negotiation scenario with a seller. You are negoti-\\nating over a mug. You have a budget of $20.”\\nWe can construct an agent with any set of attributes we want, which raises the\\nquestion of what attributes we should use.\\nWe already have the attributes that will be varied to test the SCM, but there are\\nmany others we could include. Some work has explored the endowing of agents with\\nmany different attributes, but it is unclear what is optimal, sufficient, or even neces-\\nsary.31 We take a minimalist approach, endowing our agents with goals, constraints,\\nroles, names, and any relevant proxy attributes for the exogenous variables. In the\\nfuture, we could integrate large numbers of diverse agents, perhaps constructed to\\nbe representative of some specific population.\\nA.2.1\\nAssigning agents attributes\\nThe system collects information for agents independently, similar to its one-at-a-time\\napproach with the variables in the SCM. The system randomly selects an agent,\\n31The methods have varied, ranging from endowing agents with interesting attributes (Argyle et\\nal., 2023; Horton, 2023) to using American National Election Study data to create “real” people\\n(T¨ornberg et al., 2023) to demonstrating that endowing demographic information does not nec-\\nessarily represent a population of interest (Atari et al., 2023; Santurkar et al., 2023). There is a\\nbalance to be struck. While attributes can provide a rich and nuanced simulation, they can also\\nlead to redundancy, inefficiency, and unexpected interactions. In contrast, too few attributes might\\nresult in an oversimplified and unrealistic portrayal of social interactions.\\n43\\n'}), Scenario({'filename': 'tmp9grtwdcg.pdf', 'page': 44, 'text': 'determines its attributes, and then moves on to the next agent.32 Examples of buyer\\nand seller agents with their attributes are provided in Figure A.1.\\nFigure A.1: Example agents generated by the system for “two people bargaining\\nover a mug”\\nNotes: In all simulations, agents are endowed with a randomly generated name, role, goal, con-\\nstraint, and proxy attributes for the exogenous variables. To simulate the experiment for the agents\\nin this figure, the system will generate four versions of the seller and four versions of the buyer,\\neach with one of the values for the exogenously varied attributes (assuming there are four possible\\nvalues for “Your sentimental attachment”). That is 4 × 4 = 16 treatments.\\nFor each agent, the system queries the LLM for a random name. Agents perform\\nbetter in simulations with identifiers to address one another, although this feature\\ncan be disabled. An agent’s name can also be varied as a proposed exogenous cause.\\nThe system then queries an LLM again, this time for a goal and then a constraint,\\nwhich we discuss in the following subsection.\\nFinally, the system cross-checks the values of the proxy attributes between the\\nagents to ensure they overlap appropriately.

If any discrepancies are found,\\nthe system queries the LLM again to resolve them with new values for the proxy\\nattributes. Otherwise, the simulated experiment would waste time and resources\\nbecause the induced variations were not supported across reasonable values. For ex-\\nample, if the buyer’s budget was always below the seller’s minimum acceptable\\nprice, then they might never make a deal.\\nA.2.2\\nThe importance of agent goals\\nUnlike, say, economic agents, whose goals are expressed via explicit utility func-\\ntions, the LLM agent’s goals are expressed in natural language. In the context of\\nour bargaining scenario, an example goal generated by our system for the seller\\nis to sell the mug at the highest price possible. An example constraint is\\nto not accept a price below your minimum selling price. These goals and\\nconstraints are oriented towards value, but they do not have to be; these are merely\\nthe ones generated by the system. A constraint could just have easily been do not\\nruin your reputation with your negotiating partner.\\nWe do not take a prescriptive stance on what these goals should be. We let the\\nsystem decide what is reasonable. These goals can, of course, also be the object of\\nstudy in their own right; researchers can vary them or choose their own, but they\\nare seemingly fundamental to any social science for reasons laid out in Simon (1996).\\nTherefore, explicit goals are a requirement for agents in our system.\\nA.3\\nSimulation design and execution\\nLLMs are designed to produce text. And since an independent LLM powers each\\nagent, one agent must finish speaking before the next begins. So, in any multi-agent\\nsimulation, there must be a speaking order, which raises the question of how the\\nsystem should determine this speaking order. Unfortunately, most human conver-\\nsations do not have an obvious order; people collectively figure out how to interact.\\n45\\n'}), Scenario({'filename': 'tmp9grtwdcg.pdf', 'page': 46, 'text': 'We centralize this process, but we could imagine a consensus protocol for who speaks\\nnext.\\nIn more straightforward settings with only two agents (e.g., two people bargaining\\nover a mug), the only possible conversational order is for the agents to alternate\\nspeaking. As the number of agents in interaction increases beyond two, the number\\nof possible speaking orders grows factorially. For example, with three agents, there\\nare 3! = 6 ways to order them; with 4 agents, 4! = 24 orderings, and so on. However,\\nthe number of possible orderings of the agents is only part of the complexity.\\nWho speaks next in a given conversation is a product of the participants’ per-\\nsonalities, the setting of the conversation, the social dynamics between the speakers,\\nthe emotional state of the participants, and many other factors.\\nThey are also\\nadaptive—often, the speaking order changes throughout a conversation. For exam-\\nple, in a court proceeding, the judge usually guides the interaction—signaling who\\nspeaks between the lawyers, witnesses, and the jury. Each contributes at various\\nand irregular intervals depending on both the type and stage of the proceeding. In a\\nfamily of two parents and two children, the order of who speaks next varies greatly.\\nIt might depend on the parents’ moods or how annoying the children have been that\\nday. In contrast, the teacher is typically the main speaker in a high school classroom,\\nalthough this varies depending on the classroom activity, such as a lecture versus a\\ngroup discussion.

The use of the\\ncoordinator is the only part of the system that needs quasi-omniscient supervision.\\nFortunately, LLMs perform so well that they can be used to automate this role.\\nIn the coordinator-before protocol (Figure A.2, option 5), the coordinator is\\ngiven the transcript of the conversation after each agent speaks.

Then, they interact according to\\nthe chosen interaction protocol.

Additionally, simulations are limited to 20 statements across all agents in\\nthe scenario, not including the coordinator.33 Agents are provided a live count of\\nthe remaining statements during the conversation.\\nA.3.3\\nPost-simulation survey and data collection\\nAfter the experiment, the system conducts a post-experiment survey. As determined\\nduring the SCM construction, the system asks the relevant agents or the coordinator\\nthe survey questions to measure the outcome variable in each simulation.
