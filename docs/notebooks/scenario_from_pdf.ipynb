    "# Using PDFs in a survey\n",
    "This notebook provides sample [EDSL](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/) code demonstrating a method `from_pdf()` that imports a PDF and automatically creates `Scenario` objects for the pages to use as parameters of survey questions. This can be helpful when using EDSL to extract qualitative information from a large text efficiently. \n",
    "\n",
    "EDSL is an open-source library for simulating surveys and experiments with AI agents and large language models. Please see our [documentation page](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/) for tips and tutorials on getting started.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How it works\n",
    "EDSL comes with a [variety of question types](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/questions.html) that we can select from based on the desired form of the response (multiple choice, free text, etc.). We can also parameterize questions with textual content in order to ask questions about it. We do this by creating a `{{ placeholder }}` in a question text, e.g., *What are the key themes of this text: {{ text }}*, and then creating `Scenario` objects for the content to be inserted in the placeholder when we run the survey. This allows us to administer multiple versions of a question with different inputs all at once. A common use case for this is performing [data labeling tasks](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/notebooks/data_labeling_example.html) designed as questions about one or more pieces of textual data that can be inserted into the survey question texts. [Learn more about using scenarios](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/scenarios.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "For purposes of demonstration we use a PDF copy of the first page of the recent paper [Automated Social Science:\n",
    "Language Models as Scientist and Subjects](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11794) and conduct a survey consisting of several questions about the contents of it:\n",

       "There is much work on efficiently estimating econometric models of human behavior\n",
       "but comparatively little work on efficiently generating and testing those models to\n",
       "estimate. Previously, developing such models and hypotheses to test was exclusively\n",
       "a human task. This is changing as researchers have begun to explore automated\n",
       "hypothesis generation through the use of machine learning.1 But even with novel\n",
       "machine-generated hypotheses, there is still the problem of testing.\n",
       "A potential\n",
       "solution is simulation. Researchers have shown that Large Language Models (LLM)\n",
       "can simulate humans as experimental subjects with surprising degrees of realism.2\n",
       "To the extent that these simulation results carry over to human subjects in out-of-\n",
       "sample tasks, they provide another option for testing (Horton, 2023). In this paper,\n",
       "we combine these ideas—automated hypothesis generation and automated in silico\n",
       "hypothesis testing—by using LLMs for both purposes. We demonstrate that such\n",
       "automation is possible. We evaluate the approach by comparing results to a setting\n",
       "where the real-world predictions are well known and test to see if an LLM can be\n",
       "used to generate information that it cannot access through direct elicitation.\n",
       "The key innovation in our approach is the use of structural causal models to orga-\n",

       "of cause and effect (Pearl, 2009b; Wright, 1934) and have long offered a language\n",
       "for expressing hypotheses.3 What is novel in our paper is the use of these models\n",

Previously, developing such models and hypotheses to test was exclusively\\na human task. This is changing as researchers have begun to explore automated\\nhypothesis generation through the use of machine learning.1 But even with novel\\nmachine-generated hypotheses, there is still the problem of testing.\\nA potential\\nsolution is simulation. Researchers have shown that Large Language Models (LLM)\\ncan simulate humans as experimental subjects with surprising degrees of realism.2\\nTo the extent that these simulation results carry over to human subjects in out-of-\\nsample tasks, they provide another option for testing (Horton, 2023). In this paper,\\nwe combine these ideas—automated hypothesis generation and automated in silico\\nhypothesis testing—by using LLMs for both purposes. We demonstrate that such\\nautomation is possible. We evaluate the approach by comparing results to a setting\\nwhere the real-world predictions are well known and test to see if an LLM can be\\nused to generate information that it cannot access through direct elicitation.\\nThe key innovation in our approach is the use of structural causal models to orga-\\nnize the research process. Structural causal models are mathematical representations\\nof cause and effect (Pearl, 2009b; Wright, 1934) and have long offered a language\\nfor expressing hypotheses.3 What is novel in our paper is the use of these models\\nas a blueprint for the design of agents and experiments. In short, each explanatory\\nvariable describes something about a person or scenario that has to vary for the effect\\nto be identified, so the system “knows” it needs to generate agents or scenarios that\\n1A few examples include generative adversarial networks to formulate new hypotheses (Ludwig\\nand Mullainathan, 2023), algorithms to find anomalies in formal theories (Mullainathan and Ram-\\nbachan, 2023), reinforcement learning to propose tax policies (Zheng et al., 2022), random forests\\nto identify heterogenous treatment effects (Wager and Athey, 2018), and several others (Buyalskaya\\net al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023; Enke and Shubatt, 2023; Girotra et al., 2023; Peterson et al., 2021).\\n2(Aher et al., 2023; Argyle et al., 2023; Bakker et al., 2022; Binz and Schulz, 2023b; Brand et\\nal., 2023; Bubeck et al., 2023; Fish et al., 2023; Mei et al., 2024; Park et al., 2023)\\n3In an unfortunate clash of naming conventions, some disciplines have alternative definitions\\nfor the term “structural” when discussing formal models. Here, structural does not refer to the\\ndefinition traditionally used in economics. See Appendix B for a more detailed explanation.\\n2\\n'})])"
