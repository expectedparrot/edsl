Questions
=========

.. This module contains the Question class, which is the base class for all questions in EDSL.

EDSL provides templates for many common question types, including multiple choice, checkbox, free text, numerical, linear scale and others.
The `Question` class has subclasses for each of these types: `QuestionMultipleChoice`, `QuestionCheckBox`, `QuestionFreeText`, `QuestionNumerical`, `QuestionLinearScale`, etc., 
which have methods for validating answers and responses from language models.


Question type templates 
-----------------------

A question is constructed by creating an instance of a question type class and passing the required fields.
Questions are formatted as dictionaries with specific keys based on the question type.


Question types 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following question types are available:

* `QuestionMultipleChoice` - multiple choice questions
* `QuestionCheckBox` - checkbox questions
* `QuestionFreeText` - free text questions
* `QuestionNumerical` - numerical questions
* `QuestionLinearScale` - linear scale questions
* `QuestionLikertFive` - Likert scale questions
* `QuestionRank` - ranked list questions
* `QuestionTopK` - top-k list questions
* `QuestionYesNo` - yes/no questions (multiple choice with fixed options)
* `QuestionList` - list questions
* `QuestionBudget` - budget allocation questions
* `QuestionExtract` - information extraction questions 
* `QuestionFunctional` - functional questions   


Required fields
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All question types require a `question_name` and `question_text`. 
The `question_name` is a unique Pythonic identifier for a question (e.g., "favorite_color" but not "favorite color").
The `question_text` is the text of the question itself written as a string (e.g., "What is your favorite color?").
Question types other than free text require a `question_options` list of possible answer options.
The `question_options` list can be a list of strings, integers or other types depending on the question type.

For example, to create a multiple choice question where the respondent must select one option from a list of colors, 
we import the `QuestionMultipleChoice` class and create an instance of it with the required fields:

.. code-block:: python

   from edsl import QuestionMultipleChoice

   q = QuestionMultipleChoice(
      question_name = "favorite_color",
      question_text = "What is your favorite color?",
      question_options = ["Red", "Blue", "Green", "Yellow"]
   )


Optional fields for specific question types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`min_selections` and `max_selections` - Parameters that can be added to `checkbox` and `rank` questions to specify the minimum and maximum number of options that can be selected.
For example, in a checkbox question where the respondent can select multiple options, we can specify that at least 2 options must be selected and at most 3 can be selected:

.. code-block:: python

   from edsl import QuestionCheckBox

   q = QuestionCheckBox(
      question_name = "favorite_days",
      question_text = "What are your favorite days of the week?",
      question_options = ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"],
      min_selections = 2,
      max_selections = 3
   )


`min_value` and `max_value` - Parameters that can be added to `numerical` questions to specify the minimum and maximum values that can be entered.
For example, in a numerical question where the respondent must enter a number between 1 and 10:

.. code-block:: python

   from edsl import QuestionNumerical

   q = QuestionNumerical(
      question_name = "age",
      question_text = "How old are you?",
      min_value = 1,
      max_value = 10
   )


`option_labels` - A parameter that can be added to `linear_scale` questions to specify labels for the scale options.
For example, in a linear scale question where the respondent must rate their agreement with a statement on a scale from 1 to 5:

.. code-block:: python

   from edsl import QuestionLinearScale

   q = QuestionLinearScale(
      question_name = "agree",
      question_text = "Please indicate whether you agree with the following statement: I am only happy when it rains.",
      question_options = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
      option_labels = {1: "Strongly disagree", 5: "Strongly agree"}
   )


`num_selections` - A parameter that can be added to `rank` questions to specify the number of options that must be ranked.
For example, in a rank question where the respondent must rank their top 3 favorite foods:

.. code-block:: python

   from edsl import QuestionRank

   q = QuestionRank(
      question_name = "foods_rank",
      question_text = "Rank your top 3 favorite foods.",
      question_options = ["Pizza", "Pasta", "Salad", "Soup"],
      num_selections = 3
   )


`answer_template` - A parameter that can be added to `extract` questions to specify a template for the extracted information.
For example, in an extract question where the respondent must extract information from a given text:

.. code-block:: python

   from edsl import QuestionExtract

   q = QuestionExtract(
      question_name = "course_schedule",
      question_text = """This semester we are offering courses on calligraphy on Friday mornings.""",
      answer_template = {"course_topic": "AI", "days": ["Monday", "Wednesday"]}
   )


`func` - A parameter that can be added to `functional` questions to specify a function that generates the answer.
For example, in a functional question where the answer is generated by a function:

.. code-block:: python

   from edsl import QuestionFunctional, ScenarioList, Scenario
   import random

   scenarios = ScenarioList(
      [Scenario({"persona": p, "random": random.randint(0, 1000)}) for p in ["Magician", "Economist"]]
   )

   def my_function(scenario, agent_traits):
      if scenario.get("persona") == "Magician":
         return "Magicians never pick randomly!"
      elif scenario.get("random") > 500:
         return "Top half"
      else:
         return "Bottom half"

   q = QuestionFunctional(
      question_name = "evaluate",
      func = my_function
   )

   results = q.by(scenarios).run()

   results.select("persona", "random", "evaluate").print(format="rich")


Example results:

.. code-block:: text

   ┏━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓
   ┃ scenario  ┃ scenario ┃ answer                         ┃
   ┃ .persona  ┃ .random  ┃ .evaluate                      ┃
   ┡━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┩
   │ Magician  │ 301      │ Magicians never pick randomly! │
   ├───────────┼──────────┼────────────────────────────────┤
   │ Economist │ 395      │ Bottom half                    │
   └───────────┴──────────┴────────────────────────────────┘



Optional additional parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`include_comment = False` - A boolean value that can be added to any question type (other than free text) to exclude the `comment` field.

By default, a `comment` field is automatically added to all question types other than free text.
It is a free text field that allows a model to provide any commentary on its response to the question, such as why a certain answer was chosen or how the model arrived at its answer.
It can be useful for debugging unexpected responses and reducing the likelihood that a model fails to follow formatting instructions for the main response (e.g., just selecting an answer option) because it wants to be more verbose.
It can also be helpful in constructing sequences of questions with context about prior responses (e.g., simulating a chain of thought).
(See the :ref:`survey` section for more information about adding question memory to a survey.)

`question_presentation` - A string that can be added to any question type to specify how the question should be presented to the model.
It can be used to provide additional context or instructions to the model about how to interpret the question.

`answering_instructions` - A string that can be added to any question type to specify how the model should answer the question.
It can be used to provide additional context or instructions to the model about how to format its response.

`permissive = False` - A boolean value that can be added to any question type to specify whether the model should be allowed to provide an answer that violates the question constraints (e.g., selecting fewer or more than the allowed number of options in a checkbox question).
(By default, `permissive` is set to `False` to enforce any question constraints.) 


Creating a survey
-----------------

We can combine multiple questions into a survey by passing them as a list to a `Survey` object:

.. code-block:: python 

   from edsl import QuestionLinearScale, QuestionFreeText, QuestionNumerical, Survey 

   q1 = QuestionLinearScale(
      question_name = "likely_to_vote",
      question_text = "On a scale from 1 to 5, how likely are you to vote in the upcoming U.S. election?",
      question_options = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
      option_labels = {1: "Not at all likely", 5: "Very likely"}
   )

   q2 = QuestionFreeText(
      question_name = "largest_us_city",
      question_text = "What is the largest U.S. city?"
   )

   q3 = QuestionNumerical(
      question_name = "us_pop",
      question_text = "What was the U.S. population in 2020?"
   )

   survey = Survey(questions = [q1, q2, q3])

   results = survey.run()


This allows us to administer multiple questions at once, either asynchronously (by default) or according to specified logic (e.g., skip or stop rules).
To learn more about designing surveys with conditional logic, please see the :ref:`surveys` section.


Simulating a response 
---------------------

We generate a response to a question by delivering it to a language model.
This is done by calling the `run` method for the question:

.. code-block:: python

   results = q.run()


This will generate a `Results` object that contains a single `Result` representing the response to the question and information about the model used.
If the model to be used has not been specified (as in the above example), the `run` method delivers the question to the default LLM (GPT 4).
We can inspect the response and model used by calling the `select` and `print` methods on the components of the results that we want to display.
For example, we can print just the `answer` to the question:

.. code-block:: python 

   results.select("answer.favorite_primary_color").print(format="rich")


Output:

.. code-block:: text

   ┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓
   ┃ answer                  ┃
   ┃ .favorite_primary_color ┃
   ┡━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┩
   │ blue                    │
   └─────────────────────────┘


Or to inspect the model:

.. code-block:: python 

   results.select("model").print(format="rich")


Output: 

.. code-block:: text

   ┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓
   ┃ model              ┃
   ┃ .model             ┃
   ┡━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┩
   │ gpt-4-1106-preview │
   └────────────────────┘


If questions have been combined in a survey, the `run` method is called directly on the survey instead:

.. code-block:: python

   results = survey.run()

   results.select("answer.*").print(format="rich")


Output:

.. code-block:: text

   ┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━┓
   ┃ answer          ┃ answer                                                ┃ answer    ┃
   ┃ .likely_to_vote ┃ .largest_us_city                                      ┃ .us_pop   ┃
   ┡━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━┩
   │ 4               │ The largest U.S. city by population is New York City. │ 331449281 │
   └─────────────────┴───────────────────────────────────────────────────────┴───────────┘


For a survey, each `Result` represents a response for the set of survey questions. 
To learn more about analyzing results, please see the :ref:`results` section.


Parameterizing a question
-------------------------

A question can also be constructed to take one or more parameters that are replaced with specified values either when the question is constructed or when the question is run.
This allows us to easily create and administer multiple versions of a question at once.

*Key steps*:

Create a question text that takes a parameter in double braces:

.. code-block:: python

   from edsl.questions import QuestionFreeText

   q = QuestionFreeText(
      question_name = "favorite_item",
      question_text = "What is your favorite {{ item }}?",
   )


Create a dictionary for each value that will replace the parameter and store them in `Scenario` objects:

.. code-block:: python

   from edsl import ScenarioList, Scenario

   scenarios = ScenarioList(
      Scenario({"item": item}) for item in ["color", "food"]
   )


To create multiple versions of the question when constructing a survey (i.e., before running it), pass the scenarios to the question `loop` method:

.. code-block:: python

   questions = q.loop(scenarios)


We can inspect the questions that have been created: 

.. code-block:: python

   questions 


Output:

.. code-block:: text

   [Question('free_text', question_name = """favorite_item_0""", question_text = """What is your favorite color?"""),
   Question('free_text', question_name = """favorite_item_1""", question_text = """What is your favorite food?""")]


Note that a unique `question_name` has been automatically generated based on the parameter values.
We can also specify that the paramater values be inserted in the question name (so long as they are Pythonic):

.. code-block:: python

   from edsl import QuestionFreeText, ScenarioList, Scenario

   q = QuestionFreeText(
      question_name = "favorite_{{ item }}",
      question_text = "What is your favorite {{ item }}?",
   )

   scenarios = ScenarioList(
      Scenario({"item": item}) for item in ["color", "food"]
   )

   questions = q.loop(scenarios)


Output:

.. code-block:: text

   [Question('free_text', question_name = """favorite_color""", question_text = """What is your favorite color?"""),
   Question('free_text', question_name = """favorite_food""", question_text = """What is your favorite food?""")]


To run the questions, we pass them to a `Survey` and then call the `run` method, as before:

.. code-block:: python

   from edsl import Survey

   survey = Survey(questions = questions)

   results = survey.run()


Alternatively, we can pass the scenario or scenarios to the question with the `by` method when the question is run:

.. code-block:: python 

   from edsl import QuestionFreeText, ScenarioList, Scenario

   q = QuestionFreeText(
      question_name = "favorite_item",
      question_text = "What is your favorite {{ item }}?",
   )

   scenarios = ScenarioList(
      Scenario({"item": item}) for item in ["color", "food"]
   )

   results = q.by(scenarios).run()


Each of the `Results` that are generated will include an individual `Result` for each version of the question that was answered.

To learn more about using scenarios, please see the :ref:`Scenarios` section.


Designing AI agents 
-------------------

A key feature of EDSL is the ability to design AI agents with personas and other traits for language models to use in responding to questions.
The use of agents allows us to simulate survey results for target audiences at scale.
This is done by creating `Agent` objects with dictionaries of desired traits and adding them to questions when they are run.
For example, if we want a question answered by an AI agent representing a student we can create an `Agent` object with a relevant persona and attributes:

.. code-block:: python

   from edsl import Agent

   agent = Agent(traits = {
      "persona": "You are a student...", # can be an extended text
      "age": 20, # individual trait values can be useful for analysis
      "current_grade": "college sophomore"
      })


To generate a response for the agent, we pass it to the `by` method when we run the question:

.. code-block:: python 

   results = q.by(agent).run()

We can also generate responses for multiple agents at once by passing them as a list:

.. code-block:: python

   from edsl import AgentList, Agent

   agents = AgentList(
      Agent(traits = {"persona":p}) for p in ["Dog catcher", "Magician", "Spy"]
   )

   results = q.by(scenarios).by(agents).run()


The `Results` will contain a `Result` for each agent that answered the question.
To learn more about designing agents, please see the :ref:`agents` section.


Specifying language models
--------------------------
In the above examples we did not specify a language model for the question or survey, so the default model (GPT 4) was used.
Similar to the way that we optionally passed scenarios to a question and added AI agents, we can also use the `by` method to specify one or more LLMs to use in generating results.
This is done by creating `Model` objects for desired models and optionally specifying model parameters, such as temperature.

To check available models:

.. code-block:: python

   from edsl import Model

   Model.available()

This will return a list of names of models that we can choose from.

We can also check the models for which we have already added API keys:

.. code-block:: python 

   Model.check_models()

See instructions on storing :ref:`api_keys` for the models that you want to use, or activating :ref:`remote_inference` to use the Expected Parrot server to access available models.

To specify models for a survey we first create `Model` objects:

.. code-block:: python

   from edsl import ModelList, Model 

   models = ModelList(
      Model(m) for m in ['claude-3-opus-20240229', 'llama-2-70b-chat-hf']
   )


Then we add them to a question or survey with the `by` method when running it:

.. code-block:: python 

   results = q.by(models).run()


If scenarios and/or agents are also specified, each component is added in its own `by` call, chained together in any order, with the `run` method appended last:

.. code-block:: python 

   results = q.by(scenarios).by(agents).by(models).run()
   

Note that multiple scenarios, agents and models are always passed as lists in the same `by` call.

Learn more about specifying question scenarios, agents and language models and their parameters in the respective sections:

* :ref:`scenarios`
* :ref:`agents`
* :ref:`language_models`

A subclass of the `Question` class for creating questions where the response is a ranked list of options.
It specially requires a `question_options` list of strings for the options.
The number of options that *must* be selected can be optionally specified when creating the question. 
If not specified, all options are included (ranked) in the response.
Example usage:

.. code-block:: python

   from edsl.questions import QuestionRank

QuestionList class
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A subclass of the `Question` class for creating questions where the response is a list of strings.
The maximum number of items in the list can be specified using the `max_list_items` parameter.
Example usage:

.. code-block:: python

    q = QuestionList(
        question_name = "activities",
        question_text = "What activities do you enjoy most?",
        max_list_items = 5 # optional
    )

An example can also be created using the `example` method:

    .. code-block:: python
    
        QuestionList.example()

   :special-members: __init__
   :exclude-members: allow_nonresponse, question_type, max_list_items, main


QuestionBudget class
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A subclass of the `Question` class for creating questions where the response is an allocation of a sum among a list of options in the form of a dictionary where the keys are the options and the values are the allocated amounts.
It specially requires a `question_options` list of strings for the options and a `budget_sum` number for the total sum to be allocated.
Example usage:

.. code-block:: python

   from edsl.questions import QuestionBudget

   q = QuestionBudget(
      question_name = "food_budget", 
      question_text = "How would you allocate $100?", 
      question_options = ["Pizza", "Ice cream", "Burgers", "Salad"], 
      budget_sum = 100
   )

An example can also be created using the `example` method:

.. code-block:: python
    
   QuestionBudget.example()


.. automodule:: edsl.questions.QuestionBudget
   :members:
   :undoc-members:
   :show-inheritance:
   :special-members: __init__
   :exclude-members: question_type, question_options, budget_sum, main


QuestionExtract class
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A subclass of the `Question` class for creating questions where the response is information extracted (or extrapolated) from a given text and formatted according to a specified template.
Example usage:

.. code-block:: python

    from edsl.questions import QuestionExtract

    q = QuestionExtract(
        question_name = "course_schedule",
        question_text = """This semester we are offering courses on 
        calligraphy on Friday mornings.""",
        answer_template = {"course_topic": "AI", "days": ["Monday", 
        "Wednesday"]}
    )

An example can also be created using the `example` method:
    
    .. code-block:: python

        QuestionExtract.example()


.. automodule:: edsl.questions.QuestionExtract

   :exclude-members: question_type, answer_template, main



QuestionFunctional class
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A subclass of the `Question` class for creating questions where the response is generated by a function instead of a lanugage model.
The question type is not intended to be used directly in a survey, but rather to generate responses for other questions.
This can be useful where a model is not needed for part of a survey, for questions that require some kind of initial computation, or for questions that are the result of a multi-step process.
The question type lets us define a function `func` that takes in a scenario and (optional) agent traits and returns an answer.

Example usage:

Say we have some survey results where we asked some agents to pick a random number:

.. code-block:: python

   from edsl.questions import QuestionNumerical
   from edsl import Agent

   q_random = QuestionNumerical(
      question_name = "random",
      question_text = "Choose a random number between 1 and 1000."
   )

   agents = [Agent({"persona":p}) for p in ["Dog catcher", "Magician", "Spy"]]

   results = q_random.by(agents).run()
   results.select("persona", "random").print(format="rich")


The results are:

.. code-block:: text

   ┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━┓
   ┃ agent       ┃ answer  ┃
   ┃ .persona    ┃ .random ┃
   ┡━━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━┩
   │ Dog catcher │ 472     │
   ├─────────────┼─────────┤
   │ Magician    │ 537     │
   ├─────────────┼─────────┤
   │ Spy         │ 528     │
   └─────────────┴─────────┘


We can use `QuestionFunctional` to evaluate the responses using a function instead of calling the language model to answer another question.
The responses are passed to the function as scenarios, and then the function is passed to the `QuestionFunctional` object:

.. code-block:: python

   from edsl.questions import QuestionFunctional

   def my_function(scenario, agent_traits):
      if scenario.get("persona") == "Magician":
         return "Magicians never pick randomly!"
      elif scenario.get("random") > 500:
         return "Top half"
      else:
         return "Bottom half"

   q_evaluate = QuestionFunctional(
      question_name = "evaluate",
      func = my_function
   )


Next we turn the responses into scenarios for the function:

.. code-block:: python

   scenarios = results.select("persona", "random").to_scenarios()
   scenarios

We can inspect the scenarios:

.. code-block:: python

   [Scenario({'persona': 'Dog catcher', 'random': 472}),
   Scenario({'persona': 'Magician', 'random': 537}),
   Scenario({'persona': 'Spy', 'random': 528})]


Finally, we run the function with the scenarios:

.. code-block:: python

   results = q_evaluate.by(scenarios).run()
   results.select("persona", "random", "evaluate").print(format="rich")


The results are:

.. code-block:: text

   ┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓
   ┃ scenario    ┃ scenario ┃ answer                         ┃
   ┃ .persona    ┃ .random  ┃ .evaluate                      ┃
   ┡━━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┩
   │ Dog catcher │ 472      │ Bottom half                    │
   ├─────────────┼──────────┼────────────────────────────────┤
   │ Magician    │ 537      │ Magicians never pick randomly! │
   ├─────────────┼──────────┼────────────────────────────────┤
   │ Spy         │ 528      │ Top half                       │
   └─────────────┴──────────┴────────────────────────────────┘


Another example of `QuestionFunctional` can be seen in the following notebook, where we give agents different instructions for generating random numbers and then use a function to identify whether the responses are identical.
