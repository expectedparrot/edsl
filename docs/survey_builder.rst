    Choose whether to edit or import an existing survey, auto-generate a survey,or build a new survey.

3. Design AI agents
    Choose whether to edit saved agents, import data to create new agents, auto-generate agents for a survey, or build new agents.

4. Run the survey
    Select models to run your survey and view responses at your dashboard.

5. Gather human responses
    Generate a web-based version of your survey and share it with human respondents, or launch a study with Prolific participants.

Create a survey
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`Log in <https://www.expectedparrot.com/login>`_ to your account and select options to create a `survey <https://www.expectedparrot.com/create/survey>`_ and `agents <https://www.expectedparrot.com/create/agent-list>`_.
Choose whether to build a survey and agents from scratch, import data, or select and edit saved content.


Launch a survey
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Selecting the option to *Run survey* creates a new project at your account dashboard, where you can run the survey with AI agents and human respondents.
You can also create a new project by selecting *Create project* at your dashboard and choosing a saved survey and agents to use with the project.

Your new project page has options for generating a shareable web version of the survey, running the survey with AI agents, and launching Prolific studies with human participants.
AI and human responses will automatically appear at your dashboard where you can compare and export them.


Analyze results
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once you have collected responses from AI agents and human respondents, you can analyze the results at your account dashboard or in EDSL code at your workspace.
See the :ref:`humanize` and :ref:`prolific` sections for more details about working with human responses in EDSL code.
You can also export results in CSV format for further analysis in your preferred tools.
