# Template Caching Performance Results

## üìä Performance Comparison (100 Interviews)

### Before Template Caching
- **Total execution time:** 12.166 seconds
- **Average per interview:** 121.7 ms
- **Throughput:** 8.22 interviews/second
- **Function calls:** 12,702,623
- **Template compilation time:** 0.412 seconds (builtins.compile)

### After Template Caching
- **Total execution time:** 11.619 seconds
- **Average per interview:** 116.2 ms  
- **Throughput:** 8.61 interviews/second
- **Function calls:** 6,243,855
- **Template compilation time:** 0.050 seconds (builtins.compile)

## üéØ Improvement Summary

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Total Time** | 12.166s | 11.619s | **4.5% faster** |
| **Throughput** | 8.22/sec | 8.61/sec | **4.8% increase** |
| **Function Calls** | 12.7M | 6.2M | **51% reduction** |
| **Template Compilation** | 0.412s | 0.050s | **88% reduction** |

## üîç Detailed Analysis

### Major Wins
- **88% reduction in template compilation time** (0.412s ‚Üí 0.050s)
- **51% reduction in total function calls** (12.7M ‚Üí 6.2M) 
- **Eliminated 10,620 compile calls** vs 5,538 remaining
- **Prompt rendering became much more efficient**

### Bottlenecks Still Remaining
1. **Async I/O waiting:** 7.575s (65% of execution time) - unchanged
2. **Task creation overhead:** Still high in question_task_creator.py
3. **Prompt construction pipeline:** Still 1.2s in prompt_constructor.py

### Why the improvement was modest (4.5%):
The template caching successfully eliminated the template compilation bottleneck, but **65% of execution time** is spent in async I/O waiting (`select.kqueue`), which template caching doesn't address.

## üöÄ Next Optimizations for Bigger Gains

To get more significant improvements, we need to tackle:

1. **Batch Processing** - Reduce the 16,822 async tasks to hundreds
2. **Async I/O Optimization** - Address the 7.5s spent waiting
3. **Prompt Constructor Caching** - Still 1.2s in prompt_constructor.py

## ‚úÖ Template Caching Implementation

The caching was implemented in `edsl/prompts/prompt.py` with:

```python
@lru_cache(maxsize=2048)
def _get_compiled_template(template_text: str):
    """Cache compiled Jinja2 templates for reuse."""
    env = make_env()
    return env.from_string(template_text)
```

This change alone:
- **Cut template compilation by 88%**
- **Reduced function calls by 51%** 
- **Improved throughput by 4.8%**
- **Required only 3 lines of code!**

## üéâ Conclusion

Template caching delivered exactly what we expected - it eliminated the template compilation bottleneck. The modest overall improvement (4.5%) shows that **async I/O waiting is now the dominant bottleneck** at 65% of execution time.

For bigger performance gains, we need to tackle the async task management and batching next.
