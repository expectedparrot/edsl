# Changelog

## [0.1.33] - IN PROGRESS
### Added 

- `Results` now include `generated_tokens`

- 'tree' visualization


- Ability to control exact prompt language and separate instructions from presentation of a question: `Question` objects now take optional parameters `answering_instructions` and `question_presentation` or else use default jinja2 templates in a templating system. 

- New fields for all `Question` objects:
    `include_comment`: bool = True 
    `answering_instructions`: Optional[str] = None
    `question_presentation`: Optional[str] = None
    `permissive`: bool = False

- `Question` objects parameter `include_comments = False` allows you to turn off the comments field that is automatically added to all question types other than `QuestionFreeText`. By default comments are included.

- `Question` objects parameters `answering_instructions` and `question_presentation` allow you to control the exact prompt language and separate the instructions from the presentation of a question. Example:

- `Question` objects parameter `permissive` allows you to turn off enforcement of validation checks (e.g., if min/max selections for a checkbox question have been specified, you can set `permissive = True` to allow responses that do not complay with the min/max). Example:


- `Question` method `loop()` allows you to create multiple versions of a question when you are constructing a survey. It takes a `ScenarioList` and automatically creates a copy of the question for each scenario, which can then be passed as a list to a `Survey`. This is different from adding scenarios to a question or survey (using the `by()` method) *at the time that the question or survey is run*. See the questions page for details, and example usage:

- `ScenarioList` method `unpivot()` allows you to expand a scenario list by specified identifiers; method `pivot()` allows you to undo this, collapsing scenarios by identifiers. 

- `ScenarioList` method `give_valid_names()` allows you to automatically generate valid Pythonic identifiers for scenario keys. 

- `ScenarioList` method `group_by()` allows you to group scenarios by specified identifies and apply a function to the values of the specified variables.

- `ScenarioList` method `from_wikipedia_table()` allows you to convert a Wikipedia table into a scenario list. Example usage: https://www.expectedparrot.com/content/247589dd-ad1e-45f4-9c82-e71dbeac8c96 (Notebook: *Using an LLM to Augment Existing Tabular Data*)

- The `select()` method (for `Results` and `ScenarioList`) now allows partial match on key names to save typing.

### Changed
- Improved exceptions reporting.

- Question validation methods no longer use JSON. This will eliminate exceptions relating to JSON errors previously common to certain models.

- [In progress] `QuestionMultipleChoice` may be modified to allow combined options and free response "Other" option, as well as non-responsive answers. Previously, an error was thrown if the agent did not select one of the given options. Details TBD.

### Fixed
- Bug in generation of exceptions report that excluded agent information.


## [0.1.32] - 2024-08-19
### Added
- Models: AWS Bedrock & Azure

- Question: New method `loop()` allows you to create versions of questions when you are constructing a survey. It takes a `ScenarioList()` as a parameter and returns a list of `Question` objects.

### Fixed
- Bug in `Survey` question piping prevented you from adding questions after piping.


## [0.1.31] - 2024-08-15

- `ScenarioList.from_sqlite` allows you to create a list of scenarios from a SQLite table.

- Added LaTeX support to SQL outputs and ability to write to files: `Results.print(format="latex", filename="example.tex")`

- Options that we think of as "terminal", such as `sql()`, `print()`, `html()`, etc., now take a `tee` boolean that causes them to return `self`. This is useful for chaining, e.g., if you run `print(format = "rich", tee = True)` it will return `self`, which allows you do also run `print(format = "rich", tee = True).print(format = "latex", filename = "example.tex")`.


## [0.1.30] - 2024-07-28
### Added
- Ability to create a `Scenario` for `question_options`. Example:
```
from edsl import QuestionMultipleChoice, Scenario

q = QuestionMultipleChoice(
    question_name = "capital_of_france",
    question_text = "What is the capital of France?", 
    question_options = "{{question_options}}"
)

s = Scenario({'question_options': ['Paris', 'London', 'Berlin', 'Madrid']})

results = q.by(s).run()
```


## [0.1.29] - 2024-07-21
### Added
- Prompts visibility: Call `prompts()` on a `Jobs` object for a survey to inspect the prompts that will be used in a survey before running it. For example:
```
from edsl import Model, Survey
j = Survey.example().by(Model()) 
j.prompts().print(format="rich")
```

- Piping: Use agent traits and components of questions (question_text, answer, etc.) as inputs to other questions in a survey (e.g., `question_text = "What is your last name, {{ agent.first_name }}?"` or `question_text = "Name some examples of {{ prior_q.answer }}"` or `question_options = ["{{ prior_q.answer[0]}}", "{{ prior_q.answer[1] }}"]`). Examples: https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/surveys.html#id2

- Agent traits: Call agent traits directly (e.g., `Agent.example().age` will return `22`).

### Fixed
- A bug in piping to allow you to pipe an `answer` into `question_options`. Examples: https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/surveys.html#id2


## [0.1.28] - 2024-07-09
### Added
- Method `add_columns()` allows you to add columns to `Results`.

- Class `ModelList` allows you to create a list of `Model` objects, similar to `ScenarioList` and `AgentList`.

### Changed
### Fixed
### Deprecated
### Removed


## [0.1.27] - 2024-06-28
### Added
- `Conjure` module allows you to import existing survey data and reconstruct it as EDSL objects. 
See details on methods `to_survey()`, `to_results()`, `to_agent_list()` and renaming/modifying objects: https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/conjure.html

### Changed
- Method `rename()` allows you to rename questions, agents, scenarios, results.

### Fixed
- New language models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google will be added automatically when they are released by the platforms.


## [0.1.26] - 2024-06-10
### Fixed
- Removed an errant break point in language models module.


## [0.1.25] - 2024-06-10
### Added
- `Scenario.rename()` allows you to rename fields of a scenario.

- `Scenario.chunk()` allows you to split a field into chunks of a given size based on `num_word` or `num_lines`, creating a `ScenarioList`.

- `Scenario.from_html()` turns the contents of a website into a scenario.

- `Scenario.from_image()` creates an image scenario to use with a vision model (e.g., GPT-4o).

- `ScenarioList.sample()` allows you to take a sample from a scenario list.

- `ScenarioList.tally()` allows you to tally fields in scenarios.

- `ScenarioList.expand()` allows you to expand a scenario by a field in it, e.g., if a scenario field contains a list the method can be used to break it into separate scenarios.

- `ScenarioList.mutate()` allows you to add a key/value to each scenario.

- `ScenarioList.order_by()` allows you to order the scenarios.

- `ScenarioList.filter()` allows you to filter the scenarios based on a logical expression.

- `ScenarioList.from_list()` allows you to create a ScenarioList from a list of values and specified key.

- `ScenarioList.add_list()` allows you to use a list to add values to individual scenarios.

- `ScenarioList.add_value()` allows you to add a value to all the scenarios.

- `ScenarioList.to_dict()` allows you to turn a ScenarioList into a dictionary.

- `ScenarioList.from_dict()` allows you to create a ScenarioList from a dictionary.

- `Results.drop()` complements `Results.select()` for identifying the components that you want to print in a table. 

- `ScenarioList.drop()` similarly complements `ScenarioList.select()`.

### Changed
- Improvements to exceptions reports: Survey run exceptions now include the relevant job components and are optionally displayed in an html report.


## [0.1.24] - 2024-05-28
### Added 
- We started a blog! https://blog.expectedparrot.com

- `Agent`/`AgentList` method `remove_trait(<trait_key>)` allows you to remove a trait by name. This can be useful for comparing combinations of traits.

- `Agent`/`AgentList` method `translate_traits(<codebook_dict>)` allows you to modify traits based on a codebook passed as dictionary. Example:
```
agent = Agent(traits = {"age": 45, "hair": 1, "height": 5.5})
agent.translate_traits({"hair": {1:"brown"}})
```
This will return: `Agent(traits = {'age': 10, 'hair': 'brown', 'height': 5.5})`

- `AgentList` method `get_codebook(<filename>)` returns the codebook for a CSV file.

- `AgentList` method `from_csv(<filename>)` loads an `AgentList` from a CSV file with the column names as `traits` keys. Note that the CSV column names must be valid Python identifiers (e.g., `current_age` and not `current age`).

- `Results` method `to_scenario_list()` allows you to turn any components of results into a list of scenarios to use with other questions. A default parameter `remove_prefixes=True` will remove the results component prefixes `agent.`, `answer.`, `comment.`, etc., so that you don't have to modify placeholder names for the new scenarios. Example: https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/scenarios.html#turning-results-into-scenarios

- `ScenarioList` method `to_agent_list()` converts a `ScenarioList` into an `AgentList`. 

- `ScenarioList` method `from_pdf(<filename>)` allows you to import a PDF and automatically turn the pages into a list of scenarios. Example: https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/scenarios.html#turning-pdf-pages-into-scenarios

- `ScenarioList` method `from_csv(<filename>)` allows you to import a CSV and automatically turn the rows into a list of scenarios. 

- `ScenarioList` method `from_pandas(<dataframe>)` allows you to import a pandas dataframe and automatically turn the rows into a list of scenarios. 

- `Scenario` method `from_image(<image_path>)` creates a scenario with a base64 encoding of an image. The scenario is formatted as follows: `"file_path": <filname / url>, "encoded_image": <generated_encoding>`
Note that you need to use a vision model (e.g., `model = Model('gpt-4o')`) and you do *not* need to add a `{{ placeholder }}` for the scenario (for now--this might change!).
Example:
```
from edsl.questions import QuestionFreeText
from edsl import Scenario, Model

model = Model('gpt-4o')

scenario = Scenario.from_image('general_survey.png') # Image from this notebook: https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/notebooks/data_labeling_agent.html 
# scenario

q = QuestionFreeText(
    question_name = "example",
    question_text = "What is this image showing?" # We do not need a {{ placeholder }} for this kind of scenario
)

results = q.by(scenario).by(model).run(cache=False)

results.select("example").print(format="rich")
```
Returns:
```

### Changed
- `Question` and `Survey` method `html()` generates an improved html page representation of the object. You can optionally specify the filename and css. See default css: https://github.com/expectedparrot/edsl/blob/9d981fa25a0dd83e6cca4d17bcb9316a3d452a64/edsl/surveys/SurveyExportMixin.py#L10

- `QuestionMultipleChoice` now takes numbers and lists as `question_options` (e.g., `question_options = [[1,2,3], [4,5,6]]` is allowed). Previously options had to be a list of strings (i.e., `question_options = ['1','2','3']` is still allowed but not required). 

## [0.1.23] - 2024-05-18 
### Added 
- Optional parameter in `Results` method `to_list()` to flatten a list of lists (eg, responses to `QuestionList`): `results.to_list(flatten=True)`

### Fixed
- Erroneous error messages about adding rules to a survey.

## [0.1.22] - 2024-05-14
### Added
- New `Survey` method to export a survey to file. Usage: `generated_code = survey.code("example.py")`

### Fixed
- A bug in `Survey` method `add_skip_logic()`

## [0.1.21] - 2024-05-13
### Added 
- New methods for adding, sampling and shuffling `Results` objects: 
   `dup_results = results + results`
   `results.shuffle()`
   `results.sample(n=5)`

### Changed
- Optional parameter `survey.run(cache=False)` if you do not want to access any cached results in running a survey.

- Instructions passed to an agent at creation are now a column of results: `agent_instruction`

## [0.1.20] - 2024-05-09
### Added 
- <b>Methods for setting session caches</b>
New function `set_session_cache` will set the cache for a session:

```
from edsl import Cache, set_session_cache
set_session_cache(Cache())
```
The cache can be set to a specific cache object, or it can be set to a dictionary or SQLite3Dict object:
```
from edsl import Cache, set_session_cache
from edsl.data import SQLiteDict
set_session_cache(Cache(data = SQLiteDict("example.db")))
# or
set_session_cache(Cache(data = {}))
```
The `unset_session_cache` function is used to unset the cache for a session:
```
from edsl import unset_session_cache
unset_session_cache()
```
This will unset the cache for the current session, and you will need to pass the cache object to the run method during the session.

Details: https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/data.html#setting-a-session-cache

### Changed
- <b>Answer comments are now a separate component of results</b>
The "comment" field that is automatically added to each question (other than free text) is now stored in `Results` as `comment.<question_name>`. Prior to this change, the comment for each question was stored as `answer.<question_name>_comment`, i.e., if you ran `results.columns` the list of columns would include `answer.<question_name>` and `answer.<question_name>_comment` for each question. With this change, the columns will now be `answer.<question_name>` and `comment.<question_name>_comment`. This change is meant to make it easier to select only the answers, e.g., running `results.select('answer.*').print()` will no longer also include all the comments, which you may not want to display.
(The purpose of the comments field is to allow the model to add any information about its response to a question, which can help avoid problems with JSON formatting when the model does not want to return <i>just</i> the properly formatted response.)

- <b>Exceptions</b>
We modified exception messages. If your survey run generates exceptions, run `results.show_exceptions()` to print them in a table.

### Fixed
- A package that was missing for working with Anthropic models.

## [0.1.19] - 2024-05-03
### Added
- `Results` objects now include columns for question components. Call the `.columns` method on your results to see a list of all components. Run `results.select("question_type.*", "question_text.*", "question_options.*").print()` to see them.

- `Survey` objects now also have a `.to_csv()` method.

### Changed 
- Increased the maximum number of multiple choice answer options to 200 (previously 20) to facilitate large codebooks / data labels.

## [0.1.18] - 2024-05-01
### Fixed
- A bug in in `Survey.add_rule()` method that caused an additional question to be skipped when used to apply a skip rule.

## [0.1.17] - 2024-04-29
### Added
- <b>New models:</b> Run `Model.available()` to see a complete current list.

### Fixed
- A bug in json repair methods.

## [0.1.16] - 2024-04-11
### Added
- <b>New documentation:</b> https://docs.expectedparrot.com

- <b>Progress bar:</b> 
You can now pass `progress_bar=True` to the `run()` method to see a progress bar as your survey is running. Example:
```
from edsl import Survey 
results = Survey.example().run(progress_bar=True)

                            Job Status

- <b>New language models</b>: 
We added new models from Anthropic and Databricks. To view a complete list of available models see <a href="https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/enums.html#edsl.enums.LanguageModelType">edsl.enums.LanguageModelType</a> or run:
```python
from edsl import Model
Model.available()
```
This will return:
```python
['claude-3-haiku-20240307', 
'claude-3-opus-20240229', 
'claude-3-sonnet-20240229', 
'dbrx-instruct', 
'gpt-3.5-turbo',
'gpt-4-1106-preview',
'gemini_pro',
'llama-2-13b-chat-hf',
'llama-2-70b-chat-hf',
'mixtral-8x7B-instruct-v0.1']
```
For instructions on specifying models to use with a survey see new documentation on <a href="https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/language_models.html">Language Models</a>.
<i>Let us know if there are other models that you would like us to add!</i>

### Changed
- <b>Cache:</b> 
We've improved user options for caching LLM calls. 

<i>Old method:</i>
Pass a `use_cache` boolean parameter to a `Model` object to specify whether to access cached results for the model when using it with a survey (i.e., add `use_cache=False` to generate new results, as the default value is True).

<i>How it works now:</i>
All results are (still) cached by default. To avoid using a cache (i.e., to generate fresh results), pass an empty `Cache` object to the `run()` method that will store everything in it. This can be useful if you want to isolate a set of results to share them independently of your other data. Example:
```
from edsl.data import Cache
c = Cache() # create an empty Cache object

from edsl.questions import QuestionFreeText
results = QuestionFreeText.example().run(cache = c) # pass it to the run method

c # inspect the new data in the cache
```
We can inspect the contents:
```python
Cache(data = {‘46d1b44cd30e42f0f08faaa7aa461d98’: CacheEntry(model=‘gpt-4-1106-preview’, parameters={‘temperature’: 0.5, ‘max_tokens’: 1000, ‘top_p’: 1, ‘frequency_penalty’: 0, ‘presence_penalty’: 0, ‘logprobs’: False, ‘top_logprobs’: 3}, system_prompt=‘You are answering questions as if you were a human. Do not break character. You are an agent with the following persona:\n{}’, user_prompt=‘You are being asked the following question: How are you?\nReturn a valid JSON formatted like this:\n{“answer”: “<put free text answer here>“}‘, output=’{“id”: “chatcmpl-9CGKXHZPuVcFXJoY7OEOETotJrN4o”, “choices”: [{“finish_reason”: “stop”, “index”: 0, “logprobs”: null, “message”: {“content”: “```json\\n{\\“answer\\“: \\“I\‘m doing well, thank you for asking! How can I assist you today?\\“}\\n```“, “role”: “assistant”, “function_call”: null, “tool_calls”: null}}], “created”: 1712709737, “model”: “gpt-4-1106-preview”, “object”: “chat.completion”, “system_fingerprint”: “fp_d6526cacfe”, “usage”: {“completion_tokens”: 26, “prompt_tokens”: 68, “total_tokens”: 94}}’, iteration=0, timestamp=1712709738)}, immediate_write=True, remote=False)
```
For more details see new documentation on <a href="https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/data.html">Caching LLM Calls</a>.

<i>Coming soon: Automatic remote caching options.</i>

- <b>API keys:</b> 
You will no longer be prompted to enter your API keys when running a session. We recommend storing your keys in a private `.env` file in order to avoid having to enter them at each session. Alternatively, you can still re-set your keys whenever you run a session. See instructions on setting up an `.env` file in our <a href="https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/starter_tutorial.html#part-1-using-api-keys-for-llms">Starter Tutorial</a>.

<i>The Expected Parrot API key is coming soon! It will let you access all models at once and come with automated remote caching of all results. If you would like to test it out, please let us know!</i>

- <b>Prompts:</b> 
We made it easier to modify the agent and question prompts that are sent to the models.
For more details see new documentation on <a href="https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/prompts.html">Prompts</a>.
